## Phase Details

<details>
<summary>✅ v5.1 Graph Interactivity (Phases 52-58) — SHIPPED 2026-03-21</summary>

### Phase 52: Keyboard Shortcuts & PNG Export
**Goal**: Users can navigate the graph and export diagrams without touching the mouse
**Depends on**: Phase 51 (v5.0 complete)
**Requirements**: NAV-01, NAV-02, NAV-03, EXP-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pressing F with the graph focused fits all nodes to the visible canvas area (same effect as the fit button)
  2. Pressing Esc closes the detail panel and deselects any selected node
  3. Pressing / moves keyboard focus to the search input field immediately
  4. Clicking the export button downloads a PNG file of the current canvas view including all visible nodes and edges
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 52-01-PLAN.md — keyboard.js: F/Esc/slash shortcut handler wired into graph.js
- [x] 52-02-PLAN.md — export.js + Export PNG button in toolbar wired into graph.js

### Phase 53: Clickable Detail Panel Targets
**Goal**: Users can navigate directly to a connected node from the detail panel without manually finding it
**Depends on**: Phase 52
**Requirements**: NAV-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking a service name in the detail panel's connections list selects that node and pans the canvas to center it
  2. The clicked node's detail panel opens, replacing the previous panel
  3. Clicking a target that is hidden by the current filter shows no broken behavior (click is a no-op or filter is surfaced)
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 53-01-PLAN.md — Add selectAndPanToNode helper and .conn-target click wiring

### Phase 54: Subgraph Isolation
**Goal**: Users can focus on a selected node's immediate neighborhood, hiding the rest of the graph
**Depends on**: Phase 53
**Requirements**: NAV-05, NAV-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pressing I on a selected node hides all nodes and edges not within 1 hop of that node
  2. Pressing 2 expands isolation to show all nodes and edges within 2 hops of the originally selected node
  3. Pressing 3 expands isolation to show all nodes and edges within 3 hops of the originally selected node
  4. Pressing Esc (or I again) exits isolation mode and restores the full graph view
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 54-01-PLAN.md — Add isolation state fields and getNeighborIdsNHop BFS utility
- [x] 54-02-PLAN.md — Wire isolation filter into renderer and add I/2/3/Esc keyboard handlers

### Phase 55: Scan Version API
**Goal**: The /graph API response carries scan_version_id on every service and connection so the frontend can compare recency
**Depends on**: Phase 51 (v5.0 complete — can be developed in parallel with Phases 52-54 but listed here before Phase 56)
**Requirements**: GRAPH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each service object in the /graph response includes a `scan_version_id` field with the ID of the scan that last updated it
  2. Each connection object in the /graph response includes a `scan_version_id` field with the ID of the scan that created it
  3. The maximum scan_version_id across all services represents the latest scan and is included in the response metadata
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 55-01-PLAN.md — Add scan_version_id to getGraph() SQL and /graph response, with tests

### Phase 56: What-Changed Overlay
**Goal**: Nodes and edges introduced or modified in the latest scan are visually distinct so users can spot recent changes at a glance
**Depends on**: Phase 55
**Requirements**: GRAPH-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Nodes that were created or updated in the most recent scan are visually distinguished from unchanged nodes (glow effect or "NEW" badge)
  2. Edges that were created in the most recent scan are visually distinguished from unchanged edges
  3. The visual distinction is visible without selecting the node — it appears in the default graph view
  4. Unchanged nodes and edges render identically to how they did before this feature (no visual regression)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 56-01-PLAN.md — State layer: extract scan_version_id from /graph response, add latestScanVersionId + showChanges to state
- [x] 56-02-PLAN.md — Render layer: glow ring for new nodes, bright edge for new edges, Changes toggle button

### Phase 57: Edge Bundling
**Goal**: Multiple parallel connections between the same source-target pair collapse into one weighted edge, reducing visual clutter
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Requirements**: GRAPH-01, GRAPH-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When two or more edges share the same source and target nodes, they are rendered as a single thicker edge with a numeric badge showing the count
  2. The bundled edge color/style reflects the dominant or most severe protocol type among the bundled connections
  3. Clicking a bundled edge opens the detail panel listing all individual connections within the bundle (protocol, kind, endpoint)
  4. Unbundled (unique) edges render and behave identically to pre-bundling behavior
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 57-01-PLAN.md — computeEdgeBundles + bundle rendering in renderer.js (thick line, count badge, mismatch cross)
- [x] 57-02-PLAN.md — edgeHitTest + showBundlePanel (click bundle to see all connections)

### Phase 58: Documentation
**Goal**: README and commands reference are updated to accurately describe all v5.1 graph capabilities
**Depends on**: Phase 57
**Requirements**: DOC-01, DOC-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. README contains a keyboard shortcut reference table listing F, Esc, /, I, 2, 3 with their actions
  2. README describes the PNG export button, subgraph isolation, what-changed overlay, and edge bundling in the graph UI section
  3. docs/commands.md graph UI section reflects all new interactive capabilities introduced in v5.1
**Plans**: 1 plan

<details>
<summary>✅ v5.2.0 Plugin Distribution Fix (Phases 59-62) — SHIPPED 2026-03-21</summary>

### Phase 59: Runtime Dependency Installation
**Goal**: The MCP server's runtime npm dependencies are installed into ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} on every session start, with idempotency to skip unchanged installs and a self-healing wrapper for the first-session race condition
**Depends on**: Phase 58 (v5.1 complete)
**Requirements**: DEPS-01, DEPS-02, DEPS-03, DEPS-04, MCP-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On the second session after marketplace install, all 8 MCP tools are visible to Claude (deps installed by SessionStart on first session)
  2. Running `/ligamen:map` twice does not trigger a second npm install (idempotency guard skips if runtime-deps.json is unchanged)
  3. If npm install fails mid-way, the next session retries from scratch rather than using a partial node_modules
  4. The existing session-start.sh session dedup logic is unaffected — dep install runs before SESSION_ID check
  5. The MCP wrapper script attempts self-healing dep install before exec'ing server.js, covering the first-session race
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 59-01-PLAN.md — install-deps.sh with diff-based idempotency + hooks.json wiring + bats tests
- [x] 59-02-PLAN.md — Self-healing mcp-wrapper.sh extension + .mcp.json wiring + bats tests

### Phase 60: MCP Server Launch Verification
**Goal**: The MCP server starts correctly from a marketplace-simulated install environment, with ESM resolution working without NODE_PATH and ChromaDB degrading gracefully when absent
**Depends on**: Phase 59
**Requirements**: MCP-01, MCP-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Starting the MCP server via the .mcp.json command after deps are installed at ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} produces no ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
  2. All 8 MCP tools (5 impact + 3 drift) are listed and callable after server startup
  3. Removing @chroma-core/default-embed from node_modules and restarting the server does not crash it — the 3-tier search fallback activates instead
  4. The root dev-repo .mcp.json is confirmed as {"mcpServers": {}} and does not interfere with the plugin's .mcp.json
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 60-01-PLAN.md — MCP launch verification + ChromaDB fallback + root .mcp.json validation bats tests

### Phase 61: Version Sync
**Goal**: All five manifest files are at version 5.2.0 and a bump script prevents future version drift
**Depends on**: Phase 59 (runtime-deps.json version must be set correctly before install hook reads it; can run in parallel with Phase 60)
**Requirements**: VER-01, VER-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `claude plugin marketplace add` offers version 5.2.0 of the plugin (root marketplace.json is current)
  2. All five files (root marketplace.json, plugin marketplace.json, plugin.json, package.json, runtime-deps.json) contain the same version string
  3. Running `make check` passes when all versions match and fails when any file is out of sync
  4. Running `make bump VERSION=5.3.0` updates all five files atomically in one command
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 61-01-PLAN.md — Bump all 5 manifests to 5.2.0 and verify root .mcp.json

### Phase 62: Plugin Cleanup
**Goal**: Plugin directory passes marketplace validation: metadata files present, vestigial hook config removed, all lib scripts consistently guarded against direct execution.
**Depends on**: Phase 61
**Requirements**: none (cleanup — no requirement IDs)
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Add README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore to plugins/ligamen/; delete hooks/lint.json; add source guard to lib/worker-client.sh

<details>
<summary>✅ v5.2.1 Scan Data Integrity (Phases 63-66) — SHIPPED 2026-03-21</summary>

### Phase 63: Scan Bracket Integrity
**Goal**: POST /scan endpoint applies the beginScan/endScan version bracket for atomic stale-row cleanup, and a one-time garbage collection removes legacy NULL scan_version_id rows left by pre-bracket scans
**Depends on**: Phase 62 (v5.2.0 complete)
**Requirements**: SCAN-01, SCAN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After a full scan completes, services and connections from prior scans that were not touched in the new scan are absent from the /graph response
  2. If a scan is interrupted or fails partway through, the prior scan's data remains intact — no partial updates visible in the graph
  3. Running a full scan on a repo with pre-existing NULL scan_version_id rows leaves no NULL scan_version_id rows in services or connections for that repo
  4. The /graph response returns only rows belonging to the latest scan bracket — no ghost rows from previous runs
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 63-01-PLAN.md — POST /scan: wrap persistFindings in beginScan/endScan bracket (THE-930)
- [x] 63-02-PLAN.md — endScan(): add NULL scan_version_id GC after successful bracket close (THE-931)

### Phase 64: Undefined Value Crash Chain
**Goal**: upsertService and upsertConnection sanitize JavaScript undefined values to null before SQLite binding, and the CLI fallback scan resolves the project database by explicit root path rather than process.cwd()
**Depends on**: Phase 63
**Requirements**: SREL-02, SREL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Scanning a service whose manifest produces undefined optional fields (description, version, language) completes without a SQLite binding error
  2. When the worker crashes and the CLI fallback scan runs, it writes scan results to the correct project database rather than a cwd-relative fallback path
  3. After a crash-recovery fallback scan, the /graph response reflects the correct project's data — not a phantom database created at the wrong path
  4. Re-running `/ligamen:map` after a previous crash-recovery produces a clean scan with no orphaned database files
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 64-01-PLAN.md — Add sanitizeBindings() helper to QueryEngine; patch upsertService and upsertConnection to call it before .run()
- [x] 64-02-PLAN.md — Capture PROJECT_ROOT in map.md Step 1; pass explicit root to openDb() in Step 4 node snippet

### Phase 65: Service ID Scoping
**Goal**: Cross-repo service ID resolution is scoped per project so that a service named identically in two different repos resolves to the correct ID in each context
**Depends on**: Phase 63
**Requirements**: SVCR-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Two repos each containing a service named "api-gateway" produce distinct service IDs that do not collide in the database
  2. MCP impact queries for "api-gateway" scoped to project A return only connections involving project A's service, not project B's
  3. After scanning both repos, the /graph endpoint for each project shows only that project's "api-gateway" node with its correct connections
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 65-01-PLAN.md — Scope _resolveServiceId by repoId and add ambiguity warning + tests

### Phase 66: Agent Interaction Fixes
**Goal**: The confirmation flow accepts common affirmative synonyms and re-prompts on ambiguous input; the incremental scan agent prompt explicitly constrains the scan to changed files only
**Depends on**: Phase 63
**Requirements**: CONF-01, SREL-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Responding "sure", "yep", "looks good", or "sounds good" to a confirmation prompt is accepted as affirmative — no re-prompt or silent ignore
  2. Responding with an ambiguous or unrecognized string to a confirmation prompt triggers a clear re-prompt asking for yes/no explicitly
  3. When the incremental scan agent prompt runs, the agent's scan is bounded to the set of changed files passed in the prompt — the agent does not re-scan unchanged files
  4. An incremental scan invoked with no changed files produces a no-op result rather than a full re-scan
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 66-01-PLAN.md — applyEdits synonym normalization + NEEDS_REPROMPT sentinel in confirmation.js
- [x] 66-02-PLAN.md — Incremental scan changed-files constraint injected into agent prompt in manager.js

</details>

### Phase 67: DB Foundation
**Goal**: The database has all columns and tables required for enrichment — confidence/evidence on connections, owner/auth_mechanism/db_backend on services, schemas and schema_fields tables — and query-engine exposes upsertNodeMetadata()
**Depends on**: Phase 66 (v5.2.1 complete)
**Requirements**: CONF-01, CONF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After migration 009 runs, `PRAGMA table_info(connections)` shows `confidence TEXT` and `evidence TEXT` columns
  2. After migration 009 runs, `PRAGMA table_info(services)` shows `owner TEXT`, `auth_mechanism TEXT`, and `db_backend TEXT` columns
  3. The `schemas` and `schema_fields` tables exist with indexes and the migration is idempotent — running it twice does not error
  4. `upsertNodeMetadata(serviceId, view, key, value)` is callable from a scan context and writes a row to the `node_metadata` table without triggering a scan bracket
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 67-01-PLAN.md — Migration 009: add confidence/evidence/enrichment columns + upsertNodeMetadata() method

### Phase 68: Enrichment Architecture & CODEOWNERS
**Goal**: A post-scan enrichment pass framework runs after core agent output is parsed, each enricher is isolated and gracefully silenced on failure, and the CODEOWNERS enricher correctly stores team ownership for each service
**Depends on**: Phase 67
**Requirements**: ENRICH-01, ENRICH-02, ENRICH-03, OWN-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After scanning a repo that has a CODEOWNERS file, the `services.owner` column is populated with the correct GitHub team handle for each service whose source path matches a CODEOWNERS pattern
  2. A service with no matching CODEOWNERS pattern has `owner` as NULL — not an empty string or placeholder
  3. If the CODEOWNERS enricher throws an unhandled error, the scan still completes and all primary service/connection data is persisted (the error is logged, not re-thrown)
  4. Each enricher writes metadata with a distinct `view` key in `node_metadata` — no two enrichers collide on the same key
  5. The enrichment pass does not trigger beginScan/endScan — `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM services` is unchanged after enrichment runs
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [ ] 68-01-PLAN.md — enrichment.js registry + codeowners.js parser and enricher factory
- [ ] 68-02-PLAN.md — Wire runEnrichmentPass into manager.js success path

### Phase 69: Auth & DB Extraction
**Goal**: Auth mechanism and database backend are extracted from each service's source files via regex signal tables and written to the database, with credential value exclusion preventing secret leakage
**Depends on**: Phase 68
**Requirements**: AUTHDB-01, AUTHDB-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After scanning a Node.js service that uses JWT authentication, `services.auth_mechanism` is set to a recognized mechanism string (e.g., "jwt") — not a raw credential value
  2. After scanning a service whose `schema.prisma` references PostgreSQL, `services.db_backend` is set to "postgresql"
  3. A service with no detectable auth pattern has `auth_mechanism` as NULL — not a false-positive or guessed value
  4. Extracted values never contain strings longer than 40 characters or matching credential patterns (Bearer tokens, connection strings with passwords) — the extractor rejects them before DB write
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md — auth-db-extractor.js with regex signal tables + enricher registry registration

### Phase 70: Confidence & Evidence Pipeline
**Goal**: Confidence levels and evidence snippets emitted by the agent during scanning are persisted through the upsert layer and returned on every connection object in the /graph response
**Depends on**: Phase 67
**Requirements**: CONF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After a scan where the agent emits confidence and evidence fields, `SELECT confidence FROM connections WHERE confidence IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5` returns real rows — not zero results
  2. Each connection object in the /graph API response includes `confidence` and `evidence` fields (null if not emitted by the agent)
  3. Re-scanning without confidence/evidence in agent output leaves existing confidence/evidence values in place rather than overwriting with null (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE preserves existing non-null values)
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 70-01-PLAN.md — Extend upsertConnection + getGraph() to write and return confidence/evidence with migration-009-aware fallback

### Phase 71: Schema Storage & API Extension
**Goal**: Schema and field data collected during scans is persisted in the schemas/schema_fields tables and the /graph response includes schemas_by_connection plus all enrichment fields pivoted from node_metadata
**Depends on**: Phase 70, Phase 69
**Requirements**: SCHEMA-02, OWN-02, OWN-03, AUTHDB-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After scanning a service that emits schema data, the `schemas` table contains the schema and `schema_fields` contains its fields, linked by connection_id
  2. The /graph API response includes a top-level `schemas_by_connection` map keyed by connection_id — schema data is not embedded inside per-node objects
  3. MCP `impact_query` and `impact_changed` responses include the owner field for each affected service
  4. MCP impact responses include `auth_mechanism` and `db_backend` for each affected service
  5. Re-scanning a service removes stale schema fields from prior scans — deleted fields do not accumulate across re-scans
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 71-01-PLAN.md — Extend getGraph(): schemas_by_connection, confidence/evidence on connections, owner/auth_mechanism/db_backend on services, stale schema cleanup in endScan()
- [ ] 71-02-PLAN.md — Extend enrichImpactResult and add enrichAffectedResult; wire into impact_changed MCP handler

### Phase 72: Detail Panel UI
**Goal**: The detail panel renders schema/field data, confidence badges, owner/auth/db rows, and "unknown" placeholders for all missing metadata fields — with XSS-safe rendering throughout
**Depends on**: Phase 71
**Requirements**: SCHEMA-01, OWN-02, CONF-03, UNK-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Selecting a connection in the detail panel shows a schema section with a field table (name, type, required) when schema data exists for that connection
  2. Each connection row in the detail panel displays a confidence badge (green for high, amber for low, gray for absent)
  3. The owner row in a service's detail panel shows the GitHub team handle, or "unknown" if no owner was extracted
  4. The auth mechanism and database backend rows show their values, or "unknown" when not detected — these rows are always visible, never hidden
  5. TypeScript generic type strings (e.g., `Array<Record<string, unknown>>`) render as literal characters in the panel, not as invisible HTML
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 72-01-PLAN.md — Wire enrichment fields into state + service metadata rows + confidence badges
- [ ] 72-02-PLAN.md — Schema field table in connection detail panel + tests

### Phase 73: Agent Prompts & Quality-Gate Spinout
**Goal**: Agent scan prompts explicitly require source_file on connections to reduce null paths; quality-gate command and skill are removed from this plugin in preparation for a standalone plugin
**Depends on**: Phase 67 (independent of enrichment phases; can run in parallel but placed here for sequential execution)
**Requirements**: AGENT-01, AGENT-02, AGENT-03, QGATE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After the prompt update, a scan of a repo with traceable connections produces connection rows where `source_file` is non-null for internally-connected services — the prompt guidance is specific enough to drive this behavior
  2. When the agent emits a connection without `source_file`, a validation warning is logged to the worker's structured logger — the scan still completes
  3. The detail panel connection list shows the source_file path next to each connection when the field is present
  4. The `/ligamen:quality-gate` command no longer exists in this plugin — invoking it produces "command not found" or a redirect message pointing to the standalone plugin
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 73-01-PLAN.md — agent-prompt-service/library: source_file REQUIRED section + findings.js null warning
