### 🚧 v2.3 Type-Specific Detail Panels (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Make the graph detail panel show type-appropriate data for library and infrastructure nodes — exported types/interfaces for libraries, managed resources for infra — with correct data storage replacing the broken "METHOD PATH" parser.

- [ ] **Phase 30: Storage Correctness** — Migration 007 adds `kind` column and purges malformed rows; `persistFindings()` dispatches on node type
- [ ] **Phase 31: API Surface Extension** — `getGraph()` attaches `exposes` arrays to nodes; `graph.js` forwards data into `state.graphData`
- [ ] **Phase 32: UI Detail Panels** — `utils.js` infra guard + three-way panel routing + library and infra renderers

## Phase Details

### Phase 30: Storage Correctness
**Goal**: The `exposed_endpoints` table contains only well-formed rows classified by kind, and re-scanning a library or infra repo produces correct export/resource records
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v2.3)
**Requirements**: STORE-01, STORE-02, STORE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After running migration 007, `SELECT kind FROM exposed_endpoints LIMIT 1` returns a value (column exists with default `'endpoint'`)
  2. After migration 007, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exposed_endpoints WHERE method IS NULL AND path NOT LIKE '/%'` returns 0 (malformed non-REST rows purged)
  3. After re-scanning a library repo, `SELECT path, kind FROM exposed_endpoints WHERE service_id = <lib_id>` returns full function signatures (e.g., `"functionName(param: T): R"`) with `kind = 'export'` — not whitespace-split fragments
  4. After re-scanning an infra repo, `SELECT path, kind FROM exposed_endpoints WHERE service_id = <infra_id>` returns full resource references (e.g., `"k8s:deployment/payment"`) with `kind = 'resource'`
  5. Service node re-scan continues to produce REST-format rows (`method = 'GET'`, `path = '/orders'`) with `kind = 'endpoint'`
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 30-01-PLAN.md — Migration 007: add kind column and purge malformed rows
- [ ] 30-02-PLAN.md — Fix persistFindings() type-conditional dispatch on svc.type

### Phase 31: API Surface Extension
**Goal**: The `/graph` HTTP response includes `exposes` arrays on each node and the browser graph state exposes them for click-time panel rendering
**Depends on**: Phase 30
**Requirements**: API-01, API-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A `GET /graph` response contains `"exposes": [{"kind": "...", "method": ..., "path": "..."}]` on each node that has stored endpoints, exports, or resources
  2. In browser devtools after `loadProject()`, `state.graphData.nodes` shows at least one node with a non-empty `exposes` array for a library or infra repo that has been scanned
  3. Service nodes with no stored exposes have `exposes: []` in the graph response (not `undefined` or absent)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 31-01-PLAN.md — Extend getGraph() and loadProject() to attach and forward exposes data

### Phase 32: UI Detail Panels
**Goal**: Clicking a library node shows its exported types and interfaces with consumer services; clicking an infra node shows its managed resources and wired services; clicking a service node is unchanged
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Requirements**: PANEL-01, PANEL-02, PANEL-03, PANEL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Clicking a library node opens a detail panel with an "Exports" section listing function signatures and type definitions, with functions and types grouped separately
  2. The library panel shows a "Used by" section listing services that import from the library
  3. Clicking an infra node opens a detail panel with a "Manages" section listing resources grouped by prefix (`k8s:`, `tf:`, `helm:`) with per-prefix counts
  4. The infra panel shows a "Wires" section listing services connected to the infra node
  5. Clicking a service node renders the existing service panel without any visual or behavioral change
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 32-01-PLAN.md — Infra guard in getNodeType()/getNodeColor() and NODE_TYPE_COLORS infra color
- [ ] 32-02-PLAN.md — Three-way panel routing, library exports renderer, infra resources renderer, escapeHtml
