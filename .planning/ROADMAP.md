### 🚧 v2.2 Scan Data Integrity (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix data duplication from re-scanning, enforce consistent service naming, and enable cross-project MCP queries from any repo.

- [ ] **Phase 27: Schema Foundation + Upsert Repair** — Migration 004 adds UNIQUE constraint, deduplicates existing data, rebuilds FTS5; upsert rewrite ships atomically; agent naming convention enforced
- [ ] **Phase 28: Scan Version Bracket** — Migration 005 adds scan_versions table; beginScan/endScan bracket makes re-scan atomic; stale rows cleaned up after successful persist
- [ ] **Phase 29: Cross-Project MCP Queries** — MCP tools accept optional `project` parameter; per-call DB resolution via pool.js; agents in any repo can query any project graph

## Phase Details

### Phase 27: Schema Foundation + Upsert Repair
**Goal**: Re-scanning a repo replaces its service data rather than appending duplicates, with no child-row data loss
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (v2.1 complete)
**Requirements**: SCAN-01, SCAN-02, SCAN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `/allclear:map` twice produces the same number of service rows as once — no duplicates. If the second scan discovers updated metadata (language, type, new connections), existing rows are updated in-place with the latest values.
  2. Re-scanning preserves the service row ID; connections, endpoints, schemas, and fields referencing that service are not cascade-deleted
  3. FTS5 search returns correct results after a re-scan — no stale rowid references
  4. Agent scanning output uses lowercase-hyphenated service names derived from the package manifest name field
  5. The `MAX(id) GROUP BY name` workaround is removed from `getGraph()` — graph renders directly from clean data
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 28: Scan Version Bracket
**Goal**: Each re-scan atomically replaces prior scan data so deleted services and connections are removed from the graph
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Requirements**: SCAN-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After re-scanning a repo where a service was removed, that service no longer appears in the graph
  2. If a scan fails mid-run, the previous scan's data remains intact and queryable — no partial or corrupt graph state
  3. Each completed scan is recorded as a version entry; the graph always reflects the latest completed scan
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 29: Cross-Project MCP Queries
**Goal**: MCP tools resolve the correct project database from any working directory, enabling agents to query any repo's graph
**Depends on**: Phase 27 (pool.js cleanup requires migrations 004+005 in place; can be developed in parallel but must land after Phase 27)
**Requirements**: SCAN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An agent working in repo-B can call an MCP impact tool with `project: "repo-A"` and receive correct results from repo-A's graph
  2. MCP tools with no `project` parameter continue to work as before — no breaking change for single-project users
  3. Passing an unknown project name or path returns a structured error with a hint to run `/allclear:map` first — never silent empty results
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 29-01-PLAN.md — pool.js getQueryEngineByRepo + mcp/server.js per-call resolveDb with optional project param on all 5 tools
