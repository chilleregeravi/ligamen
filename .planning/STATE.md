# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 64 — Undefined Value Crash Chain

## Current Position

Phase: 64 (Undefined Value Crash Chain) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 (complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 109 (across v1.0–v5.2.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 11
- v5.2.1 plans completed: 2/TBD

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.2.1: 7 Linear issues (THE-930 to THE-936) — all scan data integrity and reliability bugs
- v5.2.1: THE-935 and THE-936 are related — undefined→null crash triggers CLI fallback which uses wrong project hash (Phase 64)
- v5.2.1: THE-930 and THE-931 both concern scan version bracket — stale data cleanup (Phase 63)
- v5.2.1: THE-932 (SVCR-01) is independent — service ID collision fix (Phase 65)
- v5.2.1: THE-934 (CONF-01) and THE-933 (SREL-01) grouped into Phase 66 — both are agent interaction fixes
- v5.2.1: Phase 64 and Phase 65 can execute in parallel after Phase 63
- [Phase 63-scan-bracket-integrity]: endScan called only on success path — failed scans leave bracket open rather than triggering stale-row deletion
- [Phase 63-scan-bracket-integrity]: scanVersionId threaded through persistFindings as 4th arg so every row is stamped with non-null scan_version_id (fixes root cause of endScan never deleting stale rows)
- [Phase 63-scan-bracket-integrity]: endScan() now GC-deletes NULL scan_version_id connections+services after successful scan — connections deleted before services (FK order, no CASCADE)
- [Phase 63-scan-bracket-integrity]: buildDb() test helper extended to apply migrations 005+006 — without 006, QueryEngine ON CONFLICT(path) for repos fails
- [Phase 64-undefined-value-crash-chain]: CLI fallback map.md Step 4: pass PROJECT_ROOT captured in Step 1 to openDb() to ensure correct DB hash regardless of process.cwd() at node -e invocation time
- [Phase 65-service-id-scoping]: [Phase 65-service-id-scoping]: _resolveServiceId scoped by repoId — same-repo preference with global fallback and console.warn on ambiguous multi-repo matches

### Pending Todos
