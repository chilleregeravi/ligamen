# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-25)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** v0.1.3 Trust & Foundations — install architecture cleanup, scan trust hardening, deprecated command removal, update-check timeout fix

## Current Position

Phase: Roadmap complete; ready for `/gsd-plan-phase 107`
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap complete (7 phases, 45/45 requirements mapped)
Last activity: 2026-04-25 — Roadmap created with Phases 107-113

## v0.1.3 Phase Map

| Phase | Goal | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 107 | Install Architecture Cleanup — drop runtime-deps.json, sentinel + binding-load validation, simplified mcp-wrapper.sh | INST-01..12 (12) |
| 108 | Update-check Timeout Fix + `/arcanon:upload` Removal | UPD-01..06, DEP-01..06 (12) |
| 109 | Path Canonicalization + Evidence at Ingest (migration 013) | TRUST-02, 03, 10, 11 (4) |
| 110 | services.base_path End-to-End (migration 012) | TRUST-04, 12 (2) |
| 111 | Quality Score + Reconciliation Audit Trail (migrations 014, 015) | TRUST-05, 06, 13, 14 (4) |
| 112 | `/arcanon:verify` Command | TRUST-01, 07, 08, 09 (4) |
| 113 | Verification Gate (release pin) | VER-01..07 (7) |

**Wave-able phases (can run in parallel within constraints):**
- Phase 108 is independent of Phase 107 once Phase 107 lands the install path
- Phases 110/111/112 each depend on Phase 109 landing first (migration 013 path_template)
- Phase 113 always last

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 193 (v1.0–v5.8.0 + v0.1.0 + v0.1.1 12 plans + v0.1.2 9 plans)
- Total milestones shipped: 21 (Ligamen v1.0–v5.8.0 + Arcanon v0.1.0 + v0.1.1 + v0.1.2)
- v0.1.3 in progress: 7 phases planned, 0 plans drafted, 0 plans complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **v0.1.3 scope:** Two High-priority Linear tickets (THE-1022 scan trust, THE-1028 install architecture) plus THE-1027 (update-check 5s timeout) plus DEP cleanup (`/arcanon:upload` removal). Not bundling THE-1023..1026 — those go to v0.1.4 / v0.1.5.
- **`/arcanon:upload` removal brought forward from v0.2.0 → v0.1.3.** v0.1.2 already shipped a breaking change (LIGAMEN_* purge); one more removal in the same wave is consistent. Documented in CHANGELOG `### BREAKING`.
- **THE-1028 supersedes runtime-deps.json.** Single source of truth = `package.json`. Drop runtime-deps.json entirely. The `--omit=dev` flag already gives runtime-only behavior.
- **Validate, don't guess.** install-deps.sh and mcp-wrapper.sh's file-existence checks are replaced with `require("better-sqlite3")` validation. Fixes Node 25 binding bug class permanently.
- **Phase ordering trades migration grouping for REQ atomicity.** Migrations 012-015 each ship in the same phase as the runtime code that exercises them, so each REQ maps to exactly one phase. Phase 109 lands migration 013 + path canonicalization writes; Phase 110 lands migration 012 + base_path scan/resolution; Phase 111 lands migrations 014 + 015 + their wiring. Cleaner than splitting "all migrations first."
- **`/arcanon:verify` lives in Phase 112 (after data-shape phases).** The verify command reads scan data + connections.path_template + persisted evidence; depends on data shape stabilizing. Independent of Phase 110 (base_path) and Phase 111 (quality_score) but ordered after for stable test fixtures.

### Pending Todos

- Run `/gsd-plan-phase 107` to draft plans for the install-architecture cleanup phase

### Blockers/Concerns

- 2 pre-existing node test failures unrelated to v0.1.2 (`server-search.test.js` queryScan drift, `manager.test.js` incremental prompt mock) — filed for a future milestone.
- PreToolUse hook p99 latency on macOS is 130ms vs the 50ms Linux target — documented caveat, not a regression.
- `/arcanon:update --check` 5s timeout addressed by THE-1027 in this milestone (Phase 108).
