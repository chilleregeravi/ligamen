# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-19)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 92 — Manifest Parser Foundation + Language Detection + Type Extraction

## Current Position

Phase: 92 (Manifest Parser Foundation + Language Detection + Type Extraction) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-19

Progress: [          ] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 156 (across v1.0–v5.7.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 18

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(Cleared — see PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history)

- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: MANAGED sentinel chosen over silent drop for unresolved Maven/NuGet versions — preserves row visibility in drift output
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: Separate tmpfiles per Gradle DSL branch to avoid cross-contamination when build.gradle and build.gradle.kts co-exist
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: detect_language uses csharp token; detect_project_type uses dotnet token — matches CLI naming convention
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: compgen -G used for .csproj/.sln glob detection in detect_project_type (bash builtin, no subprocess)
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: drift-types.sh: added --test-only guard (mirrors drift-versions.sh) to allow bats sourcing without triggering main loop under set -euo pipefail
- [Phase 92-manifest-parsers]: C# partial class limitation documented as code comment only — cross-file merging deferred per Pitfall 13, out of Phase 92 scope

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Hub companion THE-1018 must land separately for end-to-end library drift. Plugin can ship payload v1.1 independently (hub accepts both v1.0 and v1.1 per ticket).
