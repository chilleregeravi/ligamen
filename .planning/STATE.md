# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 77 — prompt-debiasing-dead-code-removal

## Current Position

Phase: 77 (prompt-debiasing-dead-code-removal) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 128 (across v1.0–v5.3.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 13

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 75-validation-hardening P02 | 10 | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes P01 | 15 | 2 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes P02 | 8 | 1 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 76-discovery-phase-wiring P01 | 4 | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.3.0: "unknown" normalized at HTTP layer with `?? 'unknown'` — never stored as string in DB (NULL = not yet detected)
- v5.3.0: Auth extractor excludes *.test.*, *.example, *.sample files to prevent credential extraction
- v5.3.0: picomatch ^4.0.3 for CODEOWNERS glob matching; import via createRequire(import.meta.url) in ESM context
- v5.4.0: Discovery output is ephemeral prompt context only — not persisted to DB
- v5.4.0: Phase 75 (validation) can run in parallel with Phase 74 (bug fixes); Phase 76 depends on Phase 74
- v5.4.0 SVAL-01: Warn-and-skip (not hard-fail) for service type/root_path/language in validateFindings; absent type field passes; warnings array initialized before services loop
- [Phase 75-02]: execFileSync (not shell variant) for all git subprocess invocations in manager.js — eliminates shell injection surface for user-controlled repo paths
- [Phase 75-02]: Validation warnings from parseAgentOutput logged immediately after valid parse, before persistFindings — operators can see skipped services in logs
- [Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes]: SBUG-01: _stmtCheckKnownService guard prevents phantom actor hexagons — checks services table before creating actor row in persistFindings
- [Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes]: SBUG-03: enricher ctx carries repoAbsPath (absolute repo root, filesystem probe) separate from repoPath (relative service path, pattern matching)
- [Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes]: SBUG-02: docker-compose.yml is infra ONLY when no service entry-point detected — docker-compose for local dev must not misclassify Node/Python/Go services as infra
- [Phase 74-scan-bug-fixes]: SBUG-02: Poetry detection uses [tool.poetry] and [tool.poetry.scripts] (not [project]/[project.scripts]) — addresses Poetry-specific pyproject.toml format
- [Phase 76-discovery-phase-wiring]: promptDeep (agent-prompt-deep.md) used for all deep scans — type-specific prompts not used (SARC-03 Phase 77 cleanup)
- [Phase 76-discovery-phase-wiring]: beginScan bracket opens AFTER runDiscoveryPass completes — no orphaned scan_versions rows on discovery failure

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
