# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 97 — Command Cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 97 (Command Cleanup) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-04-21

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 172 (across v1.0–v5.8.0 rolled into v0.1.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 19 (Ligamen v1.0–v5.7.0 + v5.8.0 + Arcanon v0.1.0)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

(Cleared — see PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history)

- [v0.1.1]: Merge `/arcanon:upload` into `/arcanon:sync` — sync becomes the reconciliation verb; upload goes away. Rationale: "sync" correctly models the bidirectional reconcile-with-hub semantics; "upload" is only a special case.
- [v0.1.1]: Kill `/arcanon:cross-impact` outright — docs already mark it legacy and prefer `/arcanon:impact`. No backward compat burden since v0.1.0 just shipped.
- [v0.1.1]: Defer skills and agents to v0.2.0 — ship hooks first to observe real firing behavior before designing skills that layer on top.
- [v0.1.1]: PreToolUse hook fires on service-load-bearing files (`*.proto`, `openapi.*`, known service entry-points from impact-map) — deterministic, testable, doesn't depend on Claude's probabilistic skill matching.
- [v0.1.1]: `/arcanon:update` is opt-in: checks remote, asks user, then applies cleanly (reinstall + kill stale worker + prune cache + verify). Addresses the v6.0.0 → v0.1.0 stale-worker incident directly.
- Merge-then-delete sequencing for cross-impact: absorb all capabilities into impact.md first (Wave 1), then delete cross-impact.md (Wave 2) gated on bats serialization guard
- upload.md stub shells into hub.sh upload (not hub.sh sync) to preserve exact v0.1.0 code path for one version until v0.2.0
- Deprecated stub pattern established: [DEPRECATED] frontmatter + printf >&2 + $ARGUMENTS passthrough + v0.2.0 removal anchor
- Use typeof newKey !== 'undefined' (not ??) to preserve false values in two-read config fallback
- Guard hub.js main() behind import.meta.url === process.argv[1] to enable ESM import in tests
- 97-01: Outright kill of /arcanon:cross-impact with no migration stub — /arcanon:impact is canonical, docs already mark cross-impact legacy

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `/arcanon:update` depends on Claude Code CLI shape for plugin install/uninstall; if CLI changes, the command breaks. Mitigation: try CLI path first, fall back to "here are the manual commands" diagnostic if auto-flow fails.
- PreToolUse hook adds latency to Edit/Write on service files. Need to keep the impact-query path fast (<100ms target) via prepared SQLite statements.
- Phase 100 requires four empirical pre-flight validations before writing code: (1) `additionalContext` vs `systemMessage` output key for PreToolUse; (2) `db-path.sh` hash algorithm from `worker/lib/data-dir.js`; (3) `root_path` absolute vs relative convention in production DB; (4) `/impact` HTTP endpoint parameter signature from `worker/server/http.js`.
