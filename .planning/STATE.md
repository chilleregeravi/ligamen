# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** All phases available — parallel execution enabled

## Current Position

Phase: Ready (13 parallel phases, none started)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan any phase
Last activity: 2026-03-15 — Roadmap revised to parallel structure, 7 sequential phases replaced with 13 independent phases

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 29%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: npm org `@allclear` must be reserved in Phase 1 before any docs ship — squatting risk
- [Init]: Hooks are non-blocking (exit 0 always for PostToolUse); guard is blocking (exit 2 for PreToolUse deny)
- [Init]: Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`; skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/ go at plugin root
- [Init]: PULS/DPLY skills ship in v1 with graceful kubectl skip — they're optional/advanced, not blocked
- [Revision 2026-03-15]: Roadmap restructured to 13 fully parallel phases — all phases are independent file writes with no build-order dependencies; parallelization: true, granularity: fine
- [Phase 12-deploy-skill]: Single SKILL.md for deploy-verify — no supporting scripts needed; Claude executes Bash directly from skill steps
- [Phase 12-deploy-skill]: kubectl diff -k exit code 1 is informational (diffs found), not an error — must be explicitly handled in skill prompt
- [Phase 06-session-hook]: No source matcher on SessionStart: registers for all sources so bug #10373 fix is transparent when shipped
- [Phase 06-session-hook]: Dynamic hookEventName from stdin prevents silent discard when UserPromptSubmit triggers same script (Pitfall 3)
- [Phase 11-pulse-skill]: pulse-check.sh as sourceable library (not inline bash) enables bats testability for PULS-02 through PULS-05
- [Phase 11-pulse-skill]: Health endpoint priority: /health, /healthz, /actuator/health, /ready (application-first order)
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: Only plugin.json goes inside .claude-plugin/; skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/ go at plugin root
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: All hooks.json path references use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — zero hardcoded absolute paths (PLGN-04)
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: PascalCase event names in hooks.json: PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart
- [Phase 03-format-hook]: Added ALLCLEAR_DISABLE_FORMAT toggle for Phase 8 CONF-02 forward compat — one-liner cost, zero rework benefit
- [Phase 03-format-hook]: Path exclusion checks /env/ and /.tox/ beyond base patterns to cover all Python virtualenv naming conventions
- [Phase 03-format-hook]: Redirect both stdout and stderr (>/dev/null 2>&1) to silence all formatter output; redirecting only stderr leaves stdout polluted
- [Phase 04-lint-hook]: Used cksum instead of md5sum for clippy throttle key — POSIX standard, present on macOS without coreutils
- [Phase 04-lint-hook]: Clippy throttle timestamp written BEFORE run to handle concurrent PostToolUse events on same Cargo project
- [Phase 04-lint-hook]: Inline language fallback in lint.sh ensures Phase 4 hook works before lib/detect.sh (Phase 2) is deployed
- [Phase 02-shared-libraries]: Use $(cd dir && pwd) instead of realpath for POSIX-safe path resolution — realpath not guaranteed on macOS without Homebrew
- [Phase 02-shared-libraries]: detect_all_project_types returns empty string (not 'unknown') when no manifests found
- [Phase 02-shared-libraries]: No set -e in library files — sourcing context owns error handling to prevent strict-mode leakage
- [Phase 08-config-layer]: Used while-read loop instead of mapfile for bash 3.2 compatibility on macOS
- [Phase 08-config-layer]: lib/config.sh is a leaf node (sources nothing else) to prevent circular source risks
- [Phase 08-config-layer]: ALLCLEAR_CONFIG_SIBLINGS is NOT exported — bash arrays cannot be exported across subshells
- [Phase 13-tests]: Tests in RED state for invocation cases — format.sh/lint.sh are placeholders; tests turn green when Phase 3/4 implement the scripts
- [Phase 13-tests]: PATH-stub marker pattern chosen for invocation verification — stubs touch marker files, hermetic and reliable
- [Phase 07-quality-gate-skill]: Makefile targets preferred via make -qp; fix subcommand hard-scoped to lint+format only (never test/typecheck); skill documents both /allclear and /allclear:quality-gate namespace forms
- [Phase 06-session-hook]: Used isolated MOCK_PLUGIN_ROOT (mktemp -d per test) for hook script testing — complete isolation prevents test ordering issues
- [Phase 09-impact-skill]: awk classification inline with grep pipeline rather than per-line bash classify_match to avoid subshell fork overhead
- [Phase 09-impact-skill]: discover_siblings alias added in lib/siblings.sh for backward compat with Phase 02 callers while list_siblings becomes canonical name
- [Phase 09-impact-skill]: SKILL.md uses live shell injection for sibling discovery so Claude sees current sibling list at invocation time
- [Phase 13-tests]: detect.bats uses detect_all_project_types for mixed-language assertions since detect_project_type returns single type with priority ordering
- [Phase 13-tests]: Bats submodules confirmed committed by Phase 06 agent (bda446f) — tests run GREEN since lib/detect.sh and lib/siblings.sh already implemented by parallel phases
- [Phase 05-guard-hook]: Hard blocks output hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision deny JSON on stdout AND human-readable message on stderr per TEST-08 contract
- [Phase 05-guard-hook]: ALLCLEAR_EXTRA_BLOCKED checked before built-in patterns so user overrides can pre-empt soft-warn paths
- [Phase 10-drift-skill]: Type checking scoped to same-language repos by default to prevent cross-language false positives
- [Phase 10-drift-skill]: OpenAPI comparison uses oasdiff for $ref resolution; falls back to yq structural diff labeled as degraded
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: Only plugin.json goes inside .claude-plugin/; all other content (skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/) goes at plugin root
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: All path references in hooks.json use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — zero hardcoded absolute paths (PLGN-04)
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: PascalCase event names in hooks.json: PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart
- [Phase 13-tests]: file-guard.bats and session-start.bats were pre-committed from phases 05/06 with assert_failure 2 and proper stdin injection patterns already in place

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: SessionStart upstream bug #10373 — hook does not fire on brand-new sessions, only on /clear/compact/resume. Decision needed at Phase 6 planning: UserPromptSubmit fallback or document limitation.
- [Phase 7/9]: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../lib/detect.sh` relative path pattern needs runtime verification — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/detect.sh` may be more reliable.
- [Phase 7/9]: Skill namespace in `/help` (e.g., `/allclear` vs `/allclear:quality-gate`) needs verification in a dev session with `--plugin-dir` before finalizing SKILL.md frontmatter.
