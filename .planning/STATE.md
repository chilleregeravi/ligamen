# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 80 — Security Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 80 (Security Hardening) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 137 (across v1.0–v5.4.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.3.0: "unknown" normalized at HTTP layer with `?? 'unknown'` — never stored as string in DB (NULL = not yet detected)
- v5.3.0: Auth extractor excludes *.test.*, *.example, *.sample files to prevent credential extraction
- v5.4.0: Discovery output is ephemeral prompt context only — not persisted to DB
- v5.4.0: execFileSync (not shell variant) for all git subprocess invocations in manager.js
- v5.4.0: scanRepos uses Promise.allSettled for parallel agentRunner calls — retry-once on throw, skip with WARN on double failure
- v5.5.0: DINT-01/02/03/04 are already fixed in plugin cache — Phase 81 is a port, not a new implementation
- v5.5.0: SEC-01 (path traversal) is highest priority — ships in Phase 80 before any other work
- v5.5.0: QUAL-02 (map project name) is partially implemented in the command file already
- v5.5.0: Shannon entropy >= 4.0 bits/char rejects (>=, not >); 'abcdefghijkl' (3.585 entropy) is the correct near-threshold test fixture

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
