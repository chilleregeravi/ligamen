# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-16)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 22 — Canvas & Zoom

## Current Position

Phase: 22 of 26 (Canvas & Zoom)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — v2.1 roadmap created; phases 22-25 defined

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v2.1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v2.0]: Canvas not SVG for graph UI — SVG degrades at 30+ nodes, Canvas scales to 100+
- [v2.0]: Web Worker for D3 force simulation — keeps main thread free for smooth 60fps interaction
- [v2.0]: Worker logs to ~/.allclear/logs/worker.log as structured JSON (one line per entry)
- [v2.0]: Server binds to 127.0.0.1 only — never 0.0.0.0
- [v2.1 Roadmap]: Phase 23 (Logging Instrumentation) adds component tags to all worker modules — prerequisite for log filtering
- [v2.1 Roadmap]: Phase 24 (Log Terminal API) is infrastructure; all LOG requirements map to Phase 25 where user-visible outcome lives
- [v2.1 Roadmap]: Phase 22 and Phase 23 can be developed in parallel (renderer.js and logger are fully decoupled)
- [v2.1 Roadmap]: Phase 26 gated on named-handler refactor of setupInteractions() — prerequisite, not optional polish
- [Phase 22-canvas-zoom]: ctrlKey=false pans (not zooms) — mouse users use Ctrl+scroll (standard shortcut); trackpad two-finger scroll pans naturally
- [Phase 22-canvas-zoom]: Wheel zoom uses Math.pow(2, delta) exponential formula with SENSITIVITY=0.001 (D3-style, half of D3 default for gentler feel)
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: createLogger factory in worker/lib/logger.js — plain object, component-tagged JSON logging, port field omitted when undefined/null
- [Phase 22-canvas-zoom]: CSS pixel space is the single coordinate truth — DPR is render-time only; no mouse event or transform values multiplied by DPR
- [Phase 22-canvas-zoom]: watchDPR uses matchMedia re-registration (not persistent listener) for multi-monitor DPR change detection
- [Phase 22-canvas-zoom]: fitToScreen() placed inside init() closure to access container variable — bounding box formula: min(scaleX,scaleY) clamped 0.15-5, 60px padding, center translate
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: process.stderr.write used in db/database.js migration loader — no injection point, single error case, not console.error
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: setScanLogger setter injection pattern for scan/manager.js — mirrors setChromaLogger pattern, consistent approach
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: worker/ui/graph.js console.error left untouched — browser-side Canvas UI, not Node.js worker process code
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: httpLog helper in http.js merges { component: 'http' } into extra field — single logger instance shared while HTTP lines tagged distinctly
- [Phase 23-logging-instrumentation]: chroma.js uses logger injection (not import) — decoupled from dataDir/logLevel, falls back to process.stderr.write for test compat
- [Phase 24-log-terminal-api]: GET /api/logs uses synchronous fs.readFileSync — log tail is small bounded read (max 500 lines), no async benefit
- [Phase 24-log-terminal-api]: options.dataDir defaults to null in createHttpServer — tests pass null implicitly, production worker always provides it
- [Phase 26-project-switcher]: Named handlers at module scope (not inside setupInteractions) so removeEventListener can match the exact function reference
- [Phase 26-project-switcher]: loadProject(hash, canvas, fitToScreen) signature — init() passes its own closure refs; loadProject() owns data + simulation + interaction wiring
- [Phase 25-log-terminal-ui]: initLogTerminal() closure keeps poll interval handle local — not in state — start on open, clear on close
- [Phase 25-log-terminal-ui]: initLogTerminal() called in init() after loadProject() — panel is a page-level singleton, activated once when UI is interactive
- [Phase 26-project-switcher]: loadProject optional canvas: DOM fallback when called outside init() closure — project-switcher calls with hash only
- [Phase 26-project-switcher]: Transform preserved across project switch — user zoom/pan level carries over to new project graph

### Pending Todos

- **BUG: Scan data duplication** — Re-scanning a repo creates duplicate service/connection rows instead of upserting. Cross-repo scans that discover the same service (e.g. repo A and repo B both report `management-api`) also duplicate. Current workaround: `MAX(id) GROUP BY name` in getGraph(). Real fix needs:
  1. Upsert services by (repo_id, name) — re-scan replaces, not appends
  2. Cross-repo service identity merging — same service name from different repos = one node
  3. Scan versioning — each scan creates a version entry; graph shows latest version; UI can browse history
  - **Workaround applied:** `WHERE s.id IN (SELECT MAX(id) FROM services GROUP BY name)` in getGraph()
  - **Also seen:** naming inconsistencies across scans (event-journal vs event_journal) — agent prompt should enforce consistent naming

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 25 (Log Terminal UI):** SSE zombie connection leak — request.raw.on('close', cleanup) is mandatory in first implementation
- **Phase 26 (Project Switcher):** Named-function refactor of setupInteractions() must precede switcher work; anonymous handlers cannot be torn down
