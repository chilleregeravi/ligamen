# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 34 — layout-engine

## Current Position

Phase: 34 (layout-engine) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 58 (across v1.0–v3.0)
- Phase 33 plan 01: ~3 minutes, 2 tasks, 2 files created, 14 tests

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v3.0]: Services top, libraries middle, infra bottom — infra is the foundation services run on
- [v3.0]: External actors on right side — outbound connections flow right, visually outside system boundary
- [v3.0]: Minimal top bar with collapsible filter panel — Search + Project + Filters button only
- [v3.0]: Outbound external actors from scan only — no config-based or inferred inbound actors this milestone
- [v3.0]: Custom grid layout over Dagre/ELK — simple row-based layout per type layer, pull in library only if needed
- [v3.0]: node_metadata table for extensibility — avoids migration bloat for future views (STRIDE, vulns)
- [v3.0]: Separate actors table over extending services — actors have no repos, languages, or exposes
- [33-01]: ALTER TABLE idempotency via PRAGMA table_info — SQLite has no ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS
- [33-01]: Population uses INSERT OR IGNORE so migration re-runs never create duplicate actor rows
- [Phase 34]: computeLayout() pure function — deterministic positions from node type+sort, no Worker
- [Phase 34]: 18% right canvas reserved for Phase 35 actors via ACTOR_COLUMN_RESERVE_RATIO constant
- [Phase 34]: HTTP handler reads boundaries from allclear.config.json directly — avoids QueryEngine change

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Boundary data must come from user config (allclear.config.json) — auto-inference deferred due to hallucination risk
- External actor detection relies on `crossing: "external"` in scan output — verify current scan prompt captures this reliably
- Layout engine complexity — start with custom grid, only pull in Dagre/ELK if edge routing within complex boundaries demands it
