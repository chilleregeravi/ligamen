# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 59 — Runtime Dependency Installation

## Current Position

Phase: 59 of 61 (Runtime Dependency Installation)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-21 — Roadmap created for v5.2.0

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v5.2.0)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 104 (across v1.0–v5.1)
- Total milestones shipped: 10

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.2.0: Install deps into ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} via `npm install --prefix` — ESM walks up and finds node_modules automatically; no NODE_PATH needed
- v5.2.0: NODE_PATH silently ignored by ESM (Node.js v25 docs confirm); do NOT add NODE_PATH to .mcp.json
- v5.2.0: Separate hooks.json entry with timeout: 300 for install hook; existing session-start.sh entry stays at timeout: 10
- v5.2.0: Diff-based idempotency — compare runtime-deps.json to sentinel in ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}; sentinel deleted on failed install so next session retries
- v5.2.0: Self-healing MCP wrapper covers first-session race (MCP server starts before SessionStart hook finishes)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 59: Empirically confirm ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} is writable during a live SessionStart hook (dev-time confirmed user-owned; runtime not yet tested)
- Phase 59: Identify which Node binary Claude Code uses for MCP servers — ABI must match the binary that compiles better-sqlite3
- Phase 59: GitHub issue #10997 — SessionStart hooks may not fire on first marketplace install; test empirically and treat self-healing MCP wrapper as mandatory if confirmed
