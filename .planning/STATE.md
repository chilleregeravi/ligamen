# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 47 — test-doc-cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 47 (test-doc-cleanup) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 82 (across v1.0–v4.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 7

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v4.1 phases | TBD | TBD | TBD |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 46-command-removal P01 | 5 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 46-command-removal P02 | 5 | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 48-mcp-drift-tools P01 | 12 | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 47-test-doc-cleanup P01 | 5 | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Remove pulse and deploy-verify commands — Kubernetes-specific, doesn't fit core plugin focus on code quality and cross-repo intelligence
- Add drift_versions, drift_types, drift_openapi MCP tools — closes the gap between the existing `/ligamen:drift` shell command and agent-queryable MCP tooling
- [Phase 46-command-removal]: Removed pulse and deploy-verify commands — Kubernetes-specific, doesn't fit core plugin focus on code quality and cross-repo intelligence
- [Phase 46-command-removal]: Documentation updated to remove pulse/deploy-verify references — README, commands.md, and PROJECT.md now reflect only 4 remaining on-demand commands
- [Phase 48-mcp-drift-tools]: Port normalize_version and has_range_specifier from drift-versions.sh to JS helpers in server.js
- [Phase 48-mcp-drift-tools]: drift_versions severity default=WARN mirrors shell script behavior (shows WARN+CRITICAL, suppresses INFO)
- [Phase 47-test-doc-cleanup]: docs/commands.md and README.md required no changes — pulse and deploy-verify references were already removed in Phase 46
