## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v2.0]: Cross-impact redesigned from symbol grep to service dependency graph
- [v2.0]: SQLite primary, ChromaDB optional (follows claude-mem pattern)
- [v2.0]: Agent-based scanning — no external tools (tree-sitter, stack-graphs)
- [v2.0]: User confirms all findings before persisting (hard gate, not toggle)
- [v2.0]: Worker auto-starts when impact-map section present in config
- [v2.0]: Service is the unit, not repo — works for mono-repo and multi-repo
- [v2.0]: Incremental scans by default, full re-scan on demand
- [v2.0]: MCP server reads SQLite directly — no worker dependency for queries
- [v2.0]: Background subagents cannot access MCP tools (issue #13254) — agent scan runs foreground only
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: type:module added to package.json — all worker files use ESM import syntax
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: openDb() exported as named export so Plan 02 tools can import without re-opening DB
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: Fastify and HTTP deps added in 16-01 to avoid second npm install in Phase 17
- [Phase 15-01]: DATA_DIR for PID/port files is ~/.allclear (machine-wide), overridable via ALLCLEAR_DATA_DIR
- [Phase 15-01]: Port resolution order: ALLCLEAR_WORKER_PORT env -> settings.json -> allclear.config.json -> 37888
- [Phase 15-01]: PORT_FILE written before spawning so callers can read port immediately after worker-start.sh exits
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Server binds to 127.0.0.1 only — never 0.0.0.0 — hard-coded for security
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Readiness route registered first in Fastify — guarantees probe works before DB init
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: null queryEngine returns 503 on data routes — expected transient state before DB ready, not an error
- [Phase 14-01]: Top-level await used in db.js to preload ES module migrations before any openDb() call
- [Phase 14-01]: FTS5 content tables with trigger-based sync (ai/ad/au per table) chosen for incremental index updates
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Canvas not SVG for graph UI — SVG degrades at 30+ nodes, Canvas scales to 100+
- [Phase 17-http-server-web-ui]: Web Worker for D3 force simulation — keeps main thread free for smooth 60fps interaction
- [Phase 14-02]: classifyImpact is a pure mapping — caller provides the delta, engine applies severity rules without DB cross-check
- [Phase 14-02]: FTS5 queries wrapped in double-quotes to handle hyphens (svc-a parses as svc NOT a without quoting)
- [Phase 14-02]: Tests use new Database() directly instead of openDb() singleton to avoid per-test isolation failures
- [Phase 15-02]: /api/readiness registered before DB init — probe always returns 200 regardless of DB state
- [Phase 15-02]: Startup order: parse args → read settings → mkdir → write PID → register routes → listen → write port → log
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: Pure query functions exported as named exports (queryImpact etc.) to decouple from MCP SDK — enables unit testing with in-memory SQLite
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: FTS5 fallback catches 'no such table: connections_fts' specifically — avoids masking real query errors
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: MCP console.log guard placed before step-4 file check in lint.sh so CI invocations without file args still run the check
- [Phase 16-mcp-server]: Bats assert for DB-absent test uses unquoted 'results' substring since MCP SDK JSON-encodes tool response text
- [Phase 19-02]: ESM used in confirmation-flow.js instead of CommonJS — project type:module requires ESM imports for consistency
- [Phase 19-02]: confirmation-flow.js is a pure module — no I/O, no SQLite writes; Phase 20 command layer is the sole persistence gate after calling this module
- [Phase 19-repo-discovery-user-confirmation]: ESM used instead of CommonJS in repo-discovery.js — package.json type:module, all worker files use ESM
- [Phase 19-repo-discovery-user-confirmation]: discoverNew scans 5 manifest types: package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, pom.xml
- [Phase 18-agent-scanning]: Validation order: connections checked first so validateFindings({}) yields 'missing required field: connections' per spec
- [Phase 18-agent-scanning]: agent-prompt.md prohibits inference: literal string required for every reported connection
- [Phase 18-agent-scanning]: getChangedFiles uses git ls-files (not diff) for sinceCommit=null — returns all tracked files for full scan
- [Phase 18-agent-scanning]: agentRunner injection pattern: setAgentRunner(fn) decouples scan-manager.js from Claude Task tool — MCP server injects real invoker, tests inject mock
- [Phase 18-agent-scanning]: Rename detection: baseCommit must be after file-to-rename is committed — diff from before add shows A new.txt not R old.txt->new.txt
- [Phase 20-command-layer]: commands/map.md is a pure orchestration prompt — all heavy lifting delegated to Phase 15/17/18/19 infrastructure
- [Phase 20-command-layer]: First-build detection: versions list empty before Step 7 persist triggers MCP instructions + impact-map section write to allclear.config.json
- [Phase 20-02]: cross-impact is query-only — never starts the worker inline
- [Phase 20-02]: State B (worker up, no map data) still runs legacy grep to give partial results
- [Phase 21-integration-config]: VACUUM INTO used for snapshot atomicity — safer than cp because it excludes WAL/SHM sidecars
- [Phase 21-integration-config]: Snapshot paths stored relative (snapshots/timestamp.db) — portable across machine/user changes
- [Phase 21-integration-config]: worker_start_background() and worker_status_line() added to lib/worker-client.sh to fill Phase 15 implementation gap
- [Phase 21-integration-config]: session-start.sh auto-starts worker when impact-map section present in allclear.config.json — non-blocking, exits 0 always

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 18]: Agent hallucination rate unknown until tested on real repos — plan for prompt iteration loop
- [Phase 16]: MCP tool description length limits and .mcp.json registration convention should be re-verified at implementation time (MCP spec evolves)
- [Phase 17]: D3 Canvas hit detection for node click/hover requires custom point-in-circle math — spike before full UI implementation
