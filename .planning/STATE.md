# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 71 — Schema Storage & API Extension

## Current Position

Phase: 71 (Schema Storage & API Extension) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 116 (across v1.0–v5.2.1)
- Total milestones shipped: 12

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.3.0: Migration 009 must run first — all enrichment, confidence, and schema work depends on columns/tables existing
- v5.3.0: Enrichment writes to node_metadata and nullable denormalized columns only — never triggers beginScan/endScan
- v5.3.0: Schema data attaches as `schemas_by_connection` top-level map in /graph response — never embedded per-node (prevents D3 worker bloat)
- v5.3.0: "unknown" normalized at HTTP layer with `?? 'unknown'` — never stored as string in DB (NULL = not yet detected)
- v5.3.0: picomatch ^4.0.3 for CODEOWNERS glob matching; import via createRequire(import.meta.url) in ESM context
- v5.3.0: Auth extractor excludes *.test.*, *.example, *.sample files to prevent credential extraction
- [Phase 67-db-foundation]: v5.3.0: Migration 009 idempotent via PRAGMA table_info guards before ALTER TABLE — safe on partial-migration DBs
- [Phase 67-db-foundation]: v5.3.0: upsertNodeMetadata isolated from scan lifecycle — never calls beginScan/endScan, returns null gracefully on pre-migration-008 DBs
- [Phase 68-enrichment-architecture---codeowners]: Enrichment runner writes view='enrichment'; codeowners enricher writes view='ownership' directly (distinct views per ENRICH-02)
- [Phase 68-enrichment-architecture---codeowners]: clearEnrichers() export added for test isolation on module-level enrichers array
- [Phase 68-enrichment-architecture---codeowners]: queryEngine._db used to pass db to runEnrichmentPass — avoids new QueryEngine method in Phase 68 scope
- [Phase 69-auth---db-extraction]: ctx.db is raw better-sqlite3 Database (not QueryEngine) — write directly via db.prepare().run() in enrichers
- [Phase 69-auth---db-extraction]: Auth-db enricher registered in manager.js (not enricher.js which does not exist) — follows established codeowners pattern
- [Phase 70-confidence---evidence-pipeline]: v5.3.0: Three-tier try/catch for _stmtUpsertConnection: outermost tries confidence+evidence (migration 009), middle tries crossing-only (migration 008), inner is pre-migration-008 fallback
- [Phase 70-confidence---evidence-pipeline]: v5.3.0: getGraph() connections SELECT wrapped in try/catch — primary SELECT projects c.confidence, c.evidence; fallback omits them on pre-migration-009 DBs without throwing
- [Phase 71-schema-storage---api-extension]: enrichImpactResult and enrichAffectedResult never throw — try/catch wraps all node_metadata lookups for pre-migration-008 DB compatibility
- [Phase 71-schema-storage---api-extension]: impact_changed enriched with owner/auth_mechanism/db_backend via enrichAffectedResult — null fields when qe._db unavailable
- [Phase 71-schema-storage---api-extension]: v5.3.0: Schema/field cleanup in endScan() runs before stale connection delete to avoid FK violation (schemas table has no CASCADE DELETE on connections FK)
- [Phase 71-schema-storage---api-extension]: v5.3.0: getGraph() fallback connections SELECT projects null as confidence, null as evidence for type consistency on pre-migration-009 DBs

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 71 research flag: Verify whether `schemas` and `schema_fields` tables have `scan_version_id` in existing migration 001; if missing, add to Migration 009 and test stale cleanup before building UI
- Phase 69 research flag: Auth/DB regex signal table may need tuning after integration tests run on real repos; plan for iteration after initial implementation
