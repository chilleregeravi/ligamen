# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 84 — Logger Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 84 (Logger Infrastructure) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 1

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 146 (across v1.0–v5.5.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 15

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.6.0: Log rotation is size-based (10MB max, keep 3 rotated files), self-implemented (zero deps)
- v5.6.0: Logger skips stderr in daemon mode (no TTY detection) — single source of truth in log file
- v5.6.0: Scan logging at moderate verbosity (~6 lines/repo) — BEGIN/END + per-repo progress
- v5.6.0: QueryEngine gets injected logger replacing console.warn — backward-compatible optional param
- v5.6.0: All error logging adds err.stack alongside err.message
- [Phase 84-logger-infrastructure]: Rotation deletes .3 (oldest) on each rotation to keep exactly .1, .2, .3 — no .4 ever created
- [Phase 84-logger-infrastructure]: rotateIfNeeded() called after level-filter so suppressed messages do not trigger rotation
- [Phase 85-error-logging]: stack: err.stack added to all 6 catch blocks in http.js that return 500
- [Phase 86-scan-observability]: enricherCount in 'enrichment done' uses services.length (services enriched per run), not registered enricher count
- [Phase 87-logger-adoption]: pool.js passes null explicitly to document logger injection deferred to future phase when pool-level logger context is available
- [Phase 87-logger-adoption]: Optional chaining (this._logger?.warn ?? console.warn) guards against loggers missing .warn method
- [Phase 86-scan-observability]: setExtractorLogger called immediately after setScanLogger(logger) — all logger wiring in section 5 of worker/index.js
- [Phase 85-error-logging]: All 7 MCP tool handlers wrapped in try/catch with logger.error and stack: err.stack — zero unguarded logger.error calls remain in the worker

### Phase Structure

- Phase 84: LOG-01 + LOG-02 (both in logger.js — rotation + stderr dedup)
- Phase 85: ERR-01 + ERR-02 + LOG-03 (error logging in http.js, mcp/server.js, all error call sites)
- Phase 86: SCAN-01 + SCAN-02 + SCAN-03 (scan lifecycle in manager.js + extractor logger in worker/index.js)
- Phase 87: ADOPT-01 (QueryEngine optional logger param — standalone, independent of other phases)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
