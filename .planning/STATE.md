# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** v5.7.0 Scan Accuracy — Phase 89: Crossing Semantics

## Current Position

Phase: 89 of 91 (Crossing Semantics)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-23 — Roadmap created for v5.7.0

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 153 (across v1.0–v5.6.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 16

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.7.0: THE-949 redefines crossing to external/cross-service/internal (not just external/internal)
- v5.7.0: THE-949 adds post-scan reconciliation step between Step 2 and Step 3 in map.md
- v5.7.0: THE-951 adds multi-manifest detection heuristic for mono-repo discovery
- v5.7.0: THE-951 adds client_files field to discovery schema for outbound call identification
- v5.7.0: CROSS-01/02/03 grouped into Phase 89 (all touch agent prompt + map.md, same concern)
- v5.7.0: DISC-01/02 grouped into Phase 90 (both touch discovery prompt)
- v5.7.0: Phase 89 and Phase 90 can execute in parallel (different files)
- [Phase 90-discovery-improvements]: Subdirectory manifest scan limited to one level deep; client_files import scan scoped to already-opened files

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
