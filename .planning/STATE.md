# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-20)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 51 — verification

## Current Position

Phase: 51 (verification) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 88 (across v1.0–v4.1)
- Total milestones shipped: 8

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v5.0 phases | TBD | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 51-verification P01 | 3 | 2 tasks | 13 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.0: Move plugin source into `plugins/ligamen/` — required for `claude plugin marketplace add` distribution model
- v5.0: Phase 49 (file move) must complete before Phase 50 (path updates) — paths cannot be fixed until files exist in new location
- v5.0: Path updates (PTH-*) and install updates (INS-*) are bundled into Phase 50 — they are independent of each other but both depend on Phase 49
- [Phase 49]: Removed plugins/ from .gitignore before git mv — critical prerequisite so git tracks the destination directory
- [Phase 50-01]: Only drift-common.sh needed path fix (/../.. → /..); hooks.json and worker JS confirmed correct with zero changes needed
- [Phase 50]: PLUGIN_DIR now resolves to plugins/ligamen/ subdirectory; plugins/$(PLUGIN_NAME) prerequisite replaced symlink creation with existence guard
- [Phase 51-verification]: All 12 bats test path updates were pre-completed in Phase 50; Phase 51-01 verified correctness
- [Phase 51-verification]: worker-lifecycle.bats uses absolute $PLUGIN_ROOT/ prefix for script calls rather than cd in setup()

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
