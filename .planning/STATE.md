# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** All phases available — parallel execution enabled

## Current Position

Phase: Ready (13 parallel phases, none started)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan any phase
Last activity: 2026-03-15 — Roadmap revised to parallel structure, 7 sequential phases replaced with 13 independent phases

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 29%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: npm org `@allclear` must be reserved in Phase 1 before any docs ship — squatting risk
- [Init]: Hooks are non-blocking (exit 0 always for PostToolUse); guard is blocking (exit 2 for PreToolUse deny)
- [Init]: Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`; skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/ go at plugin root
- [Init]: PULS/DPLY skills ship in v1 with graceful kubectl skip — they're optional/advanced, not blocked
- [Revision 2026-03-15]: Roadmap restructured to 13 fully parallel phases — all phases are independent file writes with no build-order dependencies; parallelization: true, granularity: fine
- [Phase 12-deploy-skill]: Single SKILL.md for deploy-verify — no supporting scripts needed; Claude executes Bash directly from skill steps
- [Phase 12-deploy-skill]: kubectl diff -k exit code 1 is informational (diffs found), not an error — must be explicitly handled in skill prompt
- [Phase 06-session-hook]: No source matcher on SessionStart: registers for all sources so bug #10373 fix is transparent when shipped
- [Phase 06-session-hook]: Dynamic hookEventName from stdin prevents silent discard when UserPromptSubmit triggers same script (Pitfall 3)
- [Phase 11-pulse-skill]: pulse-check.sh as sourceable library (not inline bash) enables bats testability for PULS-02 through PULS-05
- [Phase 11-pulse-skill]: Health endpoint priority: /health, /healthz, /actuator/health, /ready (application-first order)
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: Only plugin.json goes inside .claude-plugin/; skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/ go at plugin root
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: All hooks.json path references use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — zero hardcoded absolute paths (PLGN-04)
- [Phase 01-plugin-skeleton]: PascalCase event names in hooks.json: PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: SessionStart upstream bug #10373 — hook does not fire on brand-new sessions, only on /clear/compact/resume. Decision needed at Phase 6 planning: UserPromptSubmit fallback or document limitation.
- [Phase 7/9]: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../lib/detect.sh` relative path pattern needs runtime verification — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/detect.sh` may be more reliable.
- [Phase 7/9]: Skill namespace in `/help` (e.g., `/allclear` vs `/allclear:quality-gate`) needs verification in a dev session with `--plugin-dir` before finalizing SKILL.md frontmatter.
