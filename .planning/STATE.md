# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-22)

**Core value:** Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.
**Current focus:** Phase 81 — Data Integrity Port

## Current Position

Phase: 81 (Data Integrity Port) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 137 (across v1.0–v5.4.0)
- Total milestones shipped: 14

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v5.3.0: "unknown" normalized at HTTP layer with `?? 'unknown'` — never stored as string in DB (NULL = not yet detected)
- v5.3.0: Auth extractor excludes *.test.*, *.example, *.sample files to prevent credential extraction
- v5.4.0: Discovery output is ephemeral prompt context only — not persisted to DB
- v5.4.0: execFileSync (not shell variant) for all git subprocess invocations in manager.js
- v5.4.0: scanRepos uses Promise.allSettled for parallel agentRunner calls — retry-once on throw, skip with WARN on double failure
- v5.5.0: DINT-01/02/03/04 are already fixed in plugin cache — Phase 81 is a port, not a new implementation
- v5.5.0: SEC-01 (path traversal) is highest priority — ships in Phase 80 before any other work
- v5.5.0: QUAL-02 (map project name) is partially implemented in the command file already
- v5.5.0: Shannon entropy >= 4.0 bits/char rejects (>=, not >); 'abcdefghijkl' (3.585 entropy) is the correct near-threshold test fixture
- v5.5.0: SEC-03 scan lock scope is the full repoPaths array; lock dir is $LIGAMEN_DATA_DIR or ~/.ligamen; stale detection via process.kill(pid, 0)
- [Phase 80-security-hardening]: SEC-01: path.resolve + startsWith base-dir guard replaces includes('..') in resolveDb() — handles all normalization variants
- [Phase 81-data-integrity-port]: KEY_TO_VIEW in seedMeta ensures test inserts use the same view names production queries filter on
- [Phase 81-data-integrity-port]: Version mismatch detection placed in worker-already-running branch so it fires only when a live worker is present
- [Phase 81-data-integrity-port]: DINT-02: upsertRepo queries SELECT id FROM repos WHERE path after run() — lastInsertRowid is 0 on ON CONFLICT UPDATE
- [Phase 81-data-integrity-port]: DINT-01: endScan schema pre-cleanup uses scan_version_id = ? only (no OR IS NULL) so NULL-versioned connection schemas are deleted before the connections themselves

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
