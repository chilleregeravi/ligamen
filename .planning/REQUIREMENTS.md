# Requirements: Ligamen Rebrand

## Future Requirements

None — this is a complete rename milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Backwards compatibility / migration from ~/.allclear | Clean break — user chose no migration path |
| Deprecated ALLCLEAR_* env var fallback | Clean break — no dual-name support |
| GitHub repo rename | Separate operation outside plugin codebase |
| npm publish under new name | Separate operation after code rename ships |
