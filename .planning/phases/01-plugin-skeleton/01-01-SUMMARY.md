# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: [bats-core v1.13.0, bats-assert v2.2.4, bats-support v0.3.0]
  patterns:
    - Plugin manifest at .claude-plugin/plugin.json — ONLY plugin.json inside .claude-plugin/
    - All other plugin content (skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/) at plugin root
    - ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} for all hook command references — no hardcoded absolute paths
    - PascalCase event names in hooks.json (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart)
    - Non-blocking hooks always exit 0; file-guard exits 2 to deny

key-decisions:
  - "Only plugin.json goes inside .claude-plugin/; all other content (skills/, hooks/, scripts/, lib/) goes at plugin root"
  - "All path references in hooks.json use ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — zero hardcoded absolute paths"
  - "PascalCase event names in hooks.json (PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart)"
  - "Non-blocking hooks (format.sh, lint.sh, session-start.sh) always exit 0; file-guard.sh exits 2 to deny"
  - "bats-core, bats-assert, bats-support installed as git submodules under tests/"

patterns-established:
  - "Plugin directory pattern: .claude-plugin/ contains only plugin.json; everything else at root"
  - "Hook reference pattern: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/{name}.sh for all hook commands"
  - "SKILL.md pattern: YAML frontmatter with name and description, body with title and status"
  - "Shell script pattern: shebang + header comments + exit 0 placeholder"
  - "Bats test pattern: cd to PLUGIN_ROOT in setup(), load test_helper.bash, assert with bats-assert"

# Phase 01 Plan 01: Plugin Skeleton Summary

**Claude Code plugin skeleton with plugin.json manifest, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} hooks.json, five SKILL.md placeholders, executable hook scripts, and 18 passing bats structural tests**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-15T10:07:26Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-15T10:15:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 of 3 (Task 3 is checkpoint:human-verify — awaiting user)
- **Files modified:** 17

## Accomplishments

- Created complete AllClear plugin directory structure with correct layout (.claude-plugin/ for manifest only, everything else at root)
- hooks/hooks.json wired to all four hook scripts using ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} — zero hardcoded paths, verified by grep
- All five SKILL.md files created with valid YAML frontmatter and correct names/descriptions
- All shell scripts (4 hook + 2 lib) made executable (+x), .gitattributes preserves bit across git clones
- 18 bats structural tests pass, covering PLGN-01 (directory layout) and PLGN-04 (path references)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create plugin directory structure and all scaffold files** - `bd50514` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create bats test infrastructure and structural validation tests** - `4879f15` (test)

**Plan metadata:** (pending — after checkpoint completion)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin manifest (name: allclear, version: 0.1.0, Apache-2.0)
- `hooks/hooks.json` — Hook lifecycle bindings with ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} references for all four scripts
- `skills/quality-gate/SKILL.md` — Quality gate skill placeholder with valid frontmatter
- `skills/cross-impact/SKILL.md` — Cross-impact skill placeholder with valid frontmatter
- `skills/drift/SKILL.md` — Drift skill placeholder with valid frontmatter
- `skills/pulse/SKILL.md` — Pulse skill placeholder with valid frontmatter
- `skills/deploy-verify/SKILL.md` — Deploy-verify skill placeholder with valid frontmatter
- `scripts/format.sh` — Auto-format PostToolUse hook (executable)
- `scripts/lint.sh` — Auto-lint PostToolUse hook (executable)
- `scripts/file-guard.sh` — Sensitive file PreToolUse guard (executable)
- `scripts/session-start.sh` — Session context SessionStart hook (executable)
- `lib/detect.sh` — Project type detection library stub (executable)
- `lib/siblings.sh` — Sibling repo discovery library stub (executable)
- `.gitattributes` — LF normalization and executable bit preservation for scripts/*.sh and lib/*.sh
- `package.json` — @allclear/cli npm namespace reservation (version 0.1.0)
- `tests/structure.bats` — 18 structural validation tests (PLGN-01, PLGN-04)
- `tests/test_helper.bash` — Bats test helper loading bats-support and bats-assert

## Decisions Made

- Used the already-installed bats submodule paths (tests/test_helper/bats-support, tests/test_helper/bats-assert) rather than the plan's `tests/libs/` path — submodules were pre-existing at test_helper/ from initial commit
- format.sh and lint.sh contained fuller implementations than the plan's placeholder spec — these were pre-existing files from the initial commit and are strictly better; kept them as-is

## Deviations from Plan

### Observation (not a deviation — pre-existing content)

**format.sh and lint.sh contain fuller implementations**
- **Found during:** Task 1 verification
- **Observation:** The plan specified placeholder scripts with just `exit 0`, but both scripts already had full implementations from the initial commit. These pass all verification checks (file exists, executable, contains `exit 0` at end).
- **Action:** No change — pre-existing implementations are strictly better than placeholders.

**tests/test_helper/ path instead of tests/libs/**
- **Found during:** Task 2 setup
- **Observation:** bats-support and bats-assert were installed at `tests/test_helper/bats-{support,assert}` from the initial commit, not at `tests/libs/` as the plan specified.
- **Action:** Used actual paths in test_helper.bash to match existing submodule structure. All 18 tests pass.

---

**Total deviations:** 0 blocking deviations — plan executed correctly. Two observations documented about pre-existing content from initial commit.
**Impact on plan:** No impact — all verification criteria satisfied.

## Issues Encountered

None — all tasks completed without blocking issues.

## User Setup Required

**Task 3 (checkpoint:human-verify):** Manual verification that the plugin loads via `claude --plugin-dir` and skills appear in `/help` output. Steps:

1. Run: `claude --plugin-dir /Users/ravichillerega/sources/allclear`
2. In the Claude session, type `/help` and look for AllClear skills (quality-gate, cross-impact, drift, pulse, deploy-verify)
3. Note the exact skill invocation path shown (e.g., `/allclear` vs `/allclear:quality-gate`) — this determines SKILL.md frontmatter conventions for all downstream phases
4. Exit the session

## Next Phase Readiness

- Plugin skeleton is complete and structurally valid — all phases can drop files into correct locations without structural refactoring
- PLGN-06 (plugin loads via --plugin-dir) is pending human verification in Task 3
- Blocker from STATE.md still applies: skill namespace in /help (`/allclear` vs `/allclear:quality-gate`) needs verification before finalizing SKILL.md frontmatter in phases 7-13
