# Phase 30 Plan 01: Storage Correctness — Migration 007 Summary

**SQLite migration adding `kind TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'endpoint'` to exposed_endpoints and purging malformed library/infra rows via `DELETE WHERE method IS NULL AND path NOT LIKE '/%'`**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-17T15:20:46Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-17T15:22:21Z
- **Tasks:** 1 (TDD: 2 commits — test then migration)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Migration 007 adds the `kind` discriminant column required for all v2.3 type-specific data
- Malformed rows from broken library/infra scans purged — `INSERT OR IGNORE` no longer silently blocks correct rows on re-scan
- 11 automated tests confirm STORE-01 (column existence, default, backfill) and STORE-02 (purge predicate, valid-row survival) behaviors

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1 RED: failing test for migration-007** - `bb5f5da` (test)
2. **Task 1 GREEN: implement migration 007** - `4f53fbe` (feat)

_Note: TDD task had 2 commits (test RED → feat GREEN). No REFACTOR needed._

## Files Created/Modified
- `worker/db/migrations/007_expose_kind.js` - Migration 007: adds kind column (STORE-01), purges malformed rows (STORE-02)
- `tests/storage/migration-007.test.js` - 11 unit tests covering column PRAGMA, default value, row insert, REST survival, malformed purge, valid-null-method survival, COUNT=0 assertion

## Decisions Made
- DELETE predicate confirmed: `method IS NULL AND path NOT LIKE '/%'` is the correct boundary. Validated against: malformed library rows (`ClientConfig):`, function signatures), malformed infra rows (`→`), and valid null-method REST endpoints (`/health`) which must survive.
- `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'endpoint'` chosen over nullable: enforces discriminant presence on all future inserts, and ALTER TABLE default silently backfills all existing rows to 'endpoint' without an UPDATE sweep.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Migration 007 is complete and tested. Plan 30-02 can now land the fixed parser that tags rows with `kind='library'` or `kind='infra'` and re-inserts previously blocked rows.
- The `exposed_endpoints` table UNIQUE(service_id, method, path) constraint is now clean — no malformed occupants to block re-scan inserts.
- Blocker from STATE.md resolved: DELETE predicate `method IS NULL AND path NOT LIKE '/%'` confirmed correct at test time.
