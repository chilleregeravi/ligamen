# Milestones

## v0.1.5 Identity & Privacy (Shipped: 2026-04-30)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases (123-127), 5 plans
**Requirements:** 20/21 complete (PII-01..07, AUTH-01..10, VER-01..03); VER-04 deferred — operator e2e walkthrough blocked on arcanon-hub THE-1030 deploy
**Timeline:** 2026-04-27 → 2026-04-30 (4 days)
**Stats:** 57 files changed, +9,150 / -871 lines, 45 commits squashed into PR #23 (merge commit `525a160`)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **PII path masking primitive (PII-01..07):** New `worker/lib/path-mask.js` with `maskHome` + `maskHomeDeep` (cycle-safe WeakSet, idempotent on already-relative paths, no-mutate). Wired at 4 egress seams — MCP server (`mcp/server.js:32`), HTTP routes (`/projects` + `/graph` + `/api/scan-freshness`), single-seam logger (`lib/logger.js:66`), and CLI export (mermaid/dot/html). Belt-and-suspenders parse-time reject of absolute `source_file` in `findings.parseAgentOutput` (X2 mitigation). Hardened agent contract in `agent-prompt-service.md`. Bats grep gate (`tests/pii-masking.bats`, 10 tests) + 12 unit tests + 4 PII-06 specific tests.
- **Hub auth core / X-Org-Id contract (AUTH-01..05):** Every `uploadScan` now sends `X-Org-Id` header; missing-orgId throws `HubError(code='missing_org_id')` BEFORE network attempt. New `worker/hub-sync/whoami.js` client calling `GET /api/v1/auth/whoami` returning `{user_id, key_id, scopes, grants}`. `resolveCredentials({orgIdRequired})` precedence chain: opts → `ARCANON_ORG_ID` env → `~/.arcanon/config.json#default_org_id`. `storeCredentials` spread-merge preserves unknown keys at mode 0600. Per-repo `hub.org_id` override threaded through `manager.js _readHubConfig`.
- **Whoami-driven `/arcanon:login` flow (AUTH-06):** Full 4×2 branch table (auth-error / hub-5xx / network × `--org-id` / no-flag) — AuthError NEVER stores; hub-5xx + `--org-id` stores with WARN; success on N=1 grant auto-selects; success on N>1 grants emits `__ARCANON_GRANT_PROMPT__` stdout sentinel + exit code 7 for the slash-command markdown layer to handle via `AskUserQuestion` + re-invocation with `--org-id <chosen>`. Verified-vs-mismatch differentiation when explicit `--org-id` is supplied.
- **`/arcanon:status` Identity block (AUTH-07) + 7-code RFC 7807 error parser (AUTH-08):** Nested `identity: {…}` object in `--json` mode (D-125-03 — additive contract, existing top-level keys unchanged). Frozen `HUB_ERROR_CODE_MESSAGES` map in `client.js` covers all 7 server codes (`missing_x_org_id`, `invalid_x_org_id`, `insufficient_scope`, `key_not_authorized_for_org`, `not_a_member`, `forbidden_scan`, `invalid_key`); `body.title` fallback preserved for forward-compat. `_buildIdentityBlock` 4 s timeout cap so `/arcanon:status` never hangs.
- **Auth regression test suite (AUTH-10):** `client.test.js` 7-code table-driven test exercising every entry in `HUB_ERROR_CODE_MESSAGES`; `whoami.test.js` (7 tests) pinning `getKeyInfo` contract; `integration.test.js` round-trip via new `withTempHome` async fixture (login → store → resolve → upload). Net +3 tests over Phase 124 baseline (824 total / 823 pass / 1 baseline-flake fail).
- **Release gate (VER-01..03):** All 4 manifests pinned at 0.1.5 (`package.json`, `plugins/arcanon/package.json`, `plugins/arcanon/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`); lockfile regenerated; CHANGELOG `[0.1.5]` section with explicit `### BREAKING` block citing THE-1030 hub-side dep, the `/arcanon:login --org-id` upgrade path, and the X-Org-Id requirement; bats 458/459 + node 823/824 green at v0.1.4 floors with no new pre-existing-mock carryforwards.

**Patterns established:**

- **Egress-seam masking (mask at the wire, not in the DB):** DB stores absolute paths (git operations need them); the boundary is the wire, not the store. Single primitive (`maskHomeDeep`) wrapped at every egress seam, single seam per file.
- **CLI exit-code-as-action:** exit 0 = success, exit 2 = failure, exit 7 = needs-human-decision. Markdown layer parses stdout sentinel (`__ARCANON_GRANT_PROMPT__`), prompts via `AskUserQuestion`, re-invokes CLI with the chosen flag.
- **Centralized error-code → message map:** Single `Object.freeze` constant; UI surfaces just print the message. New error codes added in one place.
- **Nested-object additive JSON contract:** When extending a status command's `--json` output, nest new structured data under a new top-level key (`identity:`) rather than spreading flat fields — protects existing consumers.
- **`withTempHome(fn)` async fixture pattern:** HOME-swap for tests touching `~/.arcanon/config.json` so the developer's real home is never mutated; reusable across phases.

**Known deferred items at close: 3 (see STATE.md `## Deferred Items`)**

The 3 deferred operator walkthroughs (125-01 T4, 125-02 T4, 127-01 T4) all unblock together when arcanon-hub THE-1030 deploys. They're operator-side validation against a real hub — not codebase gaps. Bundle into a single operator session post-deploy.

**External hub dependency:** v0.1.5 plugin codebase is shipped, but hub-half of the product (login round-trip, /arcanon:sync upload) is non-functional until arcanon-hub THE-1030 deploys server-side `X-Org-Id` enforcement and the `whoami` endpoint. Marketplace publication should wait for the hub deploy. Local features (`/arcanon:map`, `/arcanon:impact`, `/arcanon:list`, `/arcanon:diff`, `/arcanon:export`, `/arcanon:doctor`, `/arcanon:view`) work standalone.

## v0.1.3 Trust & Foundations (Shipped: 2026-04-25)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases (107-113), 14 plans
**Requirements:** 45/45 complete (INST-01..12, UPD-01..06, TRUST-01..14, DEP-01..06, VER-01..07)
**Linear:** THE-1022 (High), THE-1027, THE-1028 (High) — all closed
**Timeline:** 2026-04-25 (single-day milestone)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Install architecture rebuilt (THE-1028):** Deleted `runtime-deps.json` — single source of truth = `package.json`. Rewrote `install-deps.sh` with sha256-of-deps sentinel + `require("better-sqlite3")` binding-load validation + npm rebuild fallback. Trimmed `mcp-wrapper.sh` from 30 lines to 12 (`exec node` only). Fixes Node 25 binding bug class permanently.
- **Update-check timeout decoupled (THE-1027):** `/arcanon:update --check` now reads marketplace mirror file regardless of whether `claude plugin marketplace update` finishes within 5s. File-existence is the offline source of truth.
- **`/arcanon:upload` removed (DEP):** Deprecated stub gone (originally promised v0.2.0; brought forward to v0.1.3 since v0.1.2 already shipped a breaking change). README + skills scrubbed; CHANGELOG `### BREAKING` entry.
- **New `/arcanon:verify` command (TRUST-01):** Reads cited evidence from source files; returns `ok` / `moved` / `missing` / `method_mismatch` per connection. Read-only contract enforced. 1000-connection cap on unscoped runs.
- **Evidence-at-ingest enforcement (TRUST-02):** `persistFindings` rejects connections whose `evidence` has no literal substring match against `source_file`. Skipped, not failing the scan. Catches scanner-agent hallucinations directly.
- **Path canonicalization (TRUST-03):** Template variants like `/streams/{stream_id}` and `/streams/{name}` collapse to `/streams/{_}`. Original templates preserved in new `connections.path_template` column.
- **`services.base_path` migration (TRUST-04):** New column. Agent prompts emit it. Connection resolution strips `base_path` before path matching, eliminating false mismatches when reverse-proxies prefix-strip.
- **Per-scan quality score (TRUST-05):** New `scan_versions.quality_score` column. `endScan` computes `(high + 0.5*low)/total`. Surfaced in `/arcanon:map` end-of-output and `/arcanon:status`.
- **Reconciliation audit trail (TRUST-06):** New `enrichment_log` table + `impact_audit_log` MCP tool. `external` → `cross-service` reclassifications now write audit rows (no more silent reconciliation).
- **9th MCP tool added:** `impact_audit_log` (was 8). bats fixtures updated.

**Issues caught and fixed beyond REQs:**

- Migration 013 numbering collision (Phase 109 + Phase 110 both claimed 013) — caught at planning review, renumbered before execution
- `UNIQUE INDEX uq_connections_dedup` missing on connections table — added during 109-02 to make `INSERT OR REPLACE` actually collapse rows
- `upsertService` `lastInsertRowid` poisoning — fixed via explicit `SELECT id` post-upsert
- MCP test stdio transport hang — gated behind `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` env var
- v0.1.2's documented `worker/mcp/server-search.test.js queryScan` pre-existing failure now resolved by Phase 107-112 work

**Stats:**

- bats: 315/315 green (HOK-06 macOS latency caveat unchanged from v0.1.1; not triggered at threshold=200)
- node: 630/631 green (1 pre-existing v0.1.2 mock failure carried forward; net 1 fewer failure than v0.1.2 baseline)
- 4 manifests + package-lock.json all at 0.1.3
- ~30 new tests across worker modules

**Breaking changes for v0.1.2 → v0.1.3 upgraders:**

- `runtime-deps.json` deleted — install-deps.sh sentinel mismatch on first session post-upgrade triggers a one-time reinstall
- `/arcanon:upload` removed — CI scripts hardcoded to it must update to `/arcanon:sync`

## v0.1.2 Ligamen Residue Purge (Shipped: 2026-04-23)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases (101-105), 9 plans
**Requirements:** 46/46 complete (ENV-01..10, PATH-01..09, PKG-01..03, SRC-01..08, TST-01..07, DOC-01..03, README-01..03, VER-01..03)
**Timeline:** 2026-04-23 (single-day refactor milestone)

**Key accomplishments:**

- **Hard-removed all `LIGAMEN_*` env var reads** across worker, MCP server, libs, and scripts — no back-compat layer, no two-read fallback, no stderr deprecation warning
- **Removed `$HOME/.ligamen` data-dir fallback and `ligamen.config.json` reader** — only `$HOME/.arcanon` and `arcanon.config.json` honored
- **Renamed ChromaDB `COLLECTION_NAME`** from `"ligamen-impact"` to `"arcanon-impact"` — existing collections orphaned; users rebuild via `/arcanon:map`
- **Renamed `runtime-deps.json` package identity** from `@ligamen/runtime-deps` to `@arcanon/runtime-deps`
- **Source cosmetic sweep across 18 files** — comments, docstrings, log messages, Zod schema descriptions, agent prompts renamed or deleted where meaning became stale
- **Test suite rewrite across 17 files** — 110 renames; 1 obsolete test deleted (the `resolveCredentials ~/.ligamen/config.json` test whose functionality was removed in Phase 101)
- **README cleanup** — deleted "legacy honored for now" paragraphs, removed the entire `## Related repos` section (4 speculative outbound links)
- **CHANGELOG `### BREAKING` section** added with comprehensive migration instructions

**Breaking changes for v5.x upgraders:**

- Rename `ligamen.config.json` → `arcanon.config.json`
- Rename `$HOME/.ligamen/` → `$HOME/.arcanon/`
- Rename shell `LIGAMEN_*` env vars → `ARCANON_*`
- Rebuild ChromaDB collection via `/arcanon:map` (if using semantic search)

**Known non-regressions (documented):**

- bats 309/310 (1 macOS-only HOK-06 p99 latency caveat, pre-existing since v0.1.1, CI passes with `IMPACT_HOOK_LATENCY_THRESHOLD=100`)
- node 524/526 (2 pre-existing test failures unrelated to the rename, confirmed via git diff against pre-Phase-101 base)

## v0.1.1 Command Cleanup + Update + Ambient Hooks (Shipped: 2026-04-21)

**Phases completed:** 4 phases (97-100), 12 plans
**Requirements:** 46/46 complete
**Git range:** `d351150` → `ea081be` (49 commits, +1484/-380 LOC across 18 files)
**Timeline:** 2026-04-21 (single-day milestone)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Merged `/arcanon:cross-impact` into `/arcanon:impact` — absorbed `--exclude`, `--changed`, and the 3-state degradation model (no worker → grep fallback / worker up no map → prompt + partial / map has data → graph query) with a serialization guard so the delete only runs after the merge lands
- Shipped `/arcanon:update` self-update flow with four modes (`--check`, `--kill`, `--prune-cache`, `--verify`) — semver-correct, offline-safe, scan-lock guarded, SIGTERM→5s→SIGKILL shutdown, 10s health poll
- SessionStart banner now carries ambient cross-repo context: `"N services mapped. K load-bearing files. Last scan: date. Hub: status."` with stale prefix at 48h–7d (53ms warm-cache overhead measured)
- PreToolUse impact hook (`scripts/impact-hook.sh`) — Tier 1 bash pattern match for schema files (*.proto, openapi.*, swagger.*), Tier 2 SQLite root_path prefix match with trailing-slash guard, worker HTTP primary + SQLite fallback, self-exclusion inside `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `ARCANON_DISABLE_HOOK` + `ARCANON_IMPACT_DEBUG` env guards
- `auto_upload` → `auto_sync` rename across plugin.json userConfig, `worker/cli/hub.js`, `worker/scan/manager.js` with two-read fallback (`cfg?.hub?.["auto-sync"] ?? cfg?.hub?.["auto-upload"]`) + stderr deprecation warning on legacy key reads
- Deprecated `/arcanon:upload` stub preserved for one release (forwards to `/arcanon:sync` with stderr warning) so hardcoded CI pipelines don't break

**Deferred to Linear:**

- THE-1022 (High — scan quality), THE-1023 (read-only command polish), THE-1024 (scan ops), THE-1025 (UX polish), THE-1026 (integration improvements) — 18 of 20 external review points filed; 2 folded into this milestone

**Known tech debt:**

- `session-start.sh` duplicates `lib/db-path.sh` hash logic inline (consolidation opportunity, not a bug)
- `commands/update.md` has a stale "Phase 1 status" planning-era paragraph (cosmetic)
