# Milestones

## v3.0 Layered Graph & Intelligence (Shipped: 2026-03-18)

**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 11 plans, 0 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Migration 008 adds `actors`, `actor_connections`, and `node_metadata` tables for external system tracking and extensible metadata
- Deterministic layered layout engine replaces D3 force simulation — services/libraries/infra in stable rows with row wrapping
- Boundary grouping via `allclear.config.json` — dashed rounded rectangles with labels around service clusters
- External actor detection from scan `crossing` field — hexagon nodes in dedicated right column with detail panel
- Protocol-differentiated edge styles: solid (REST), dashed (gRPC), dotted (events), arrowed (SDK), red (mismatch)
- Minimal top bar with collapsible filter panel — protocol, layer, boundary, language, mismatch-only, hide-isolated filters
- ChromaDB embeddings enriched with boundary context and actor relationships
- MCP `impact_query` and `impact_search` responses carry type-aware summaries and actor relationship sentences

## v2.3 Type-Specific Detail Panels (Shipped: 2026-03-18)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 5 plans, 0 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- Migration 007 adds `kind` column to `exposed_endpoints` with COALESCE unique index for NULL-safe dedup
- `persistFindings()` type-conditional dispatch: services split METHOD/PATH, libraries store raw signatures, infra stores raw resource refs
- `getGraph()` attaches per-node `exposes` arrays with graceful pre-migration degradation
- Three-way detail panel routing: library panel (Exports + Used by), infra panel (Manages + Wires), service panel unchanged
- XSS-safe rendering with `escapeHtml()` on all scan-derived string insertions

## v2.2 Scan Data Integrity (Shipped: 2026-03-16)

**Phases completed:** 3 phases, 5 plans, 0 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- UNIQUE(repo_id, name) constraint with in-place dedup + ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE upsert preserving row IDs across re-scans
- Scan version bracket (beginScan/endScan) with atomic stale-row cleanup — failed scans leave prior data intact
- Agent prompt service naming convention enforcing manifest-derived, lowercase-hyphenated names
- Cross-project MCP queries via per-call resolveDb dispatching by path/hash/repo name

## v2.1 UI Polish & Observability (Shipped: 2026-03-16)

**Phases completed:** 5 phases, 11 plans, 0 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- HiDPI/Retina-crisp canvas rendering with devicePixelRatio scaling and smooth exponential zoom/pan
- Shared structured logger with component tags across all worker modules (zero console.log in production code)
- Collapsible log terminal with 2s polling, ring buffer, component filter, keyword search, and auto-scroll
- Persistent project switcher with full event listener teardown and force worker termination between projects
