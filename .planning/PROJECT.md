# AllClear

## What This Is

An open-source Claude Code plugin that provides automated quality gates, cross-repo service dependency intelligence, and continuous formatting/linting hooks for multi-repository development workflows. Includes an interactive graph UI for visualizing service dependencies with real-time log observability. Designed for teams managing multiple repos across Python, Rust, TypeScript, and Go — detects project type automatically and runs the right tools without configuration.

## Core Value

Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.

## Requirements

- ✓ Optional ChromaDB vector sync with 3-tier search fallback — v2.0
- ✓ Exposed endpoint cross-referencing for API mismatch detection — v2.0

- ✓ HiDPI/Retina canvas rendering with devicePixelRatio scaling — v2.1
- ✓ Smooth zoom/pan with trackpad pinch/scroll split (ctrlKey) — v2.1
- ✓ Fit-to-screen button to center all nodes — v2.1
- ✓ Shared structured logger with component tags across all worker modules — v2.1
- ✓ Collapsible log terminal with real-time streaming, component filter, keyword search — v2.1
- ✓ Persistent project switcher dropdown with full teardown and in-place reload — v2.1

### Active

(Defined per milestone — see current milestone below)

### Out of Scope

- Linear issue enrichment — other plugins cover this; no external service dependencies
- GitHub Issues integration — same reasoning
- Any issue tracker integration — keep AllClear focused on code and infrastructure
- RamaEdge-specific logic — plugin must remain generic and framework-agnostic
- Auto-fix for test/typecheck failures — unsafe, may silently alter code semantics
- xterm.js interactive terminal — log viewer uses styled div, not a full terminal emulator

## Context

Shipped v2.1 with ~7,500 LOC (Node.js worker, Canvas UI, shell scripts, bats tests). 26 phases across 3 milestones, 47 plans. Plugin installed via marketplace and operational.

Architecture: commands/ for user-invoked features, skills/ for auto-invoked knowledge, hooks/ for formatting/linting/guarding, worker/ for Node.js daemon (db/, server/, scan/, mcp/, ui/ subdirectories), lib/ for shared bash/JS libraries.

Known tech debt: scan data duplication on re-scan (workaround in place), no log rotation, db/database.js has console.log in script-mode guard.

## Constraints

- **Plugin format**: Must follow Claude Code plugin conventions (commands/, skills/, hooks.json)
- **Framework-agnostic**: Detect project type from files, never assume a specific framework
- **No external service deps**: Every command must work with only local files, git, and optionally kubectl
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Testing**: Bats-core for hook shell scripts, node:test for worker JS
- **Detect, don't configure**: Infer everything from project files; zero-config by default with optional overrides via allclear.config.json
- **Non-blocking hooks**: Format/lint hooks must not block edits on failure — warn and continue
- **Cross-repo discovery**: Auto-detect linked repos from parent directory, override with config file

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dedicated repo (not part of claude-code) | Clean separation between private orchestration and open-source plugin | ✓ Good |
| Drop /allclear scope | Other plugins handle issue enrichment; keeps AllClear zero external deps | ✓ Good |
| Apache 2.0 license | Permissive with patent protection, standard for dev tools | ✓ Good |
| Auto-detect + config override for linked repos | Parent dir scan works for flat layouts, config.json for custom setups | ✓ Good |
| Canvas not SVG for graph UI | SVG degrades at 30+ nodes, Canvas scales to 100+ | ✓ Good |
| Web Worker for D3 force simulation | Keeps main thread free for smooth 60fps interaction | ✓ Good |
| Cross-impact v2 as separate milestone | Service dependency intelligence is a major new capability | ✓ Good |
| CSS pixel space as single coordinate truth | DPR is render-time only; no mouse/transform values multiplied by DPR | ✓ Good |
| Polling over SSE for log terminal | No zombie connection risk, 2s latency imperceptible for log viewer | ✓ Good |
| Named handlers for teardown | Module-scope named functions enable removeEventListener for project switching | ✓ Good |
| Shared logger factory with component tags | Enables log filtering without coupling modules to each other | ✓ Good |
| Graph dedup via MAX(id) GROUP BY name | Workaround for scan duplication — proper fix needs schema changes (SCAN-01..04) | ⚠️ Revisit |
