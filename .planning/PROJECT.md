# Ligamen

## What This Is

An open-source Claude Code plugin that provides automated quality gates, cross-repo service dependency intelligence, and continuous formatting/linting hooks for multi-repository development workflows. Includes an interactive graph UI for visualizing service dependencies with real-time log observability. Designed for teams managing multiple repos across Python, Rust, TypeScript, and Go — detects project type automatically and runs the right tools without configuration.

## Core Value

Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.

### Active

(No active requirements — start next milestone with `/gsd-new-milestone`)

### Out of Scope

- Linear issue enrichment — other plugins cover this; no external service dependencies
- GitHub Issues integration — same reasoning
- Any issue tracker integration — keep Ligamen focused on code and infrastructure
- RamaEdge-specific logic — plugin must remain generic and framework-agnostic
- Auto-fix for test/typecheck failures — unsafe, may silently alter code semantics
- xterm.js interactive terminal — log viewer uses styled div, not a full terminal emulator
- Backwards compatibility with `~/.allclear/` or `ALLCLEAR_*` — clean break, no migration path

## Context

Shipped v5.8.0 — 96 phases across 19 milestones, 172 plans. Library-level drift now flows end-to-end on the plugin side (hub-side companion THE-1018 still pending for full deployment). Repo restructured as Claude Code marketplace — plugin source lives under `plugins/ligamen/`, installable via `claude plugin marketplace add` + `claude plugin install`. MCP server has 8 tools (5 impact + 3 drift). Runtime deps installed automatically on first session via SessionStart hook + self-healing MCP wrapper. Post-scan enrichment architecture extracts team ownership (CODEOWNERS), auth mechanisms, and database backends. Confidence/evidence on connections, schema/field data in detail panel.

Architecture: commands/ for user-invoked features, skills/ for auto-invoked knowledge, hooks/ for formatting/linting/guarding, worker/ for Node.js daemon (db/, server/, scan/, mcp/, ui/ subdirectories), lib/ for shared bash/JS libraries. Two-phase scan pipeline: discovery agent (Phase 1) detects languages/frameworks/entry-points, then deep scan agent (Phase 2) receives discovery context via {{DISCOVERY_JSON}} for language-aware analysis. Agent prompts modularized into type-specific variants (service, library, infra) with shared common component and multi-language examples. Parallel scan fan-out with retry-once error handling. Three-value crossing semantics (external/cross-service/internal) with post-scan reconciliation that downgrades false externals. Graph UI uses deterministic layered layout with boundary grouping, actor dedup filter, and protocol-differentiated edges. Filter panel provides protocol, layer, boundary, language, mismatch, and isolated-node toggles. Production-grade logging with size-based rotation, structured error logging with stack traces across all modules, and scan lifecycle observability.

Known tech debt: db/database.js has console.log in script-mode guard, getQueryEngineByHash inline migration workaround, renderLibraryConnections() unused `outgoing` parameter, node_metadata table unused (forward-looking for STRIDE/vuln views), impact-flow.bats imports stale module paths (pre-existing from v3.0 restructure), package.json bin entry references non-existent ligamen-init.js, graph-fit-to-screen.test.js has 2 stale assertions for inlined fitToScreen() (Phase 26 regression).

## Constraints

- **Plugin format**: Must follow Claude Code plugin conventions (commands/, skills/, hooks.json)
- **Framework-agnostic**: Detect project type from files, never assume a specific framework
- **No external service deps**: Every command must work with only local files and git
- **License**: AGPL-3.0-only
- **Testing**: Bats-core for hook shell scripts, node:test for worker JS
- **Detect, don't configure**: Infer everything from project files; zero-config by default with optional overrides via ligamen.config.json
- **Non-blocking hooks**: Format/lint hooks must not block edits on failure — warn and continue
- **Cross-repo discovery**: Auto-detect linked repos from parent directory, override with config file

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dedicated repo (not part of claude-code) | Clean separation between private orchestration and open-source plugin | ✓ Good |
| Drop /allclear scope (renamed to /ligamen) | Other plugins handle issue enrichment; keeps Ligamen zero external deps | ✓ Good |
| Apache 2.0 license | Permissive with patent protection, standard for dev tools | ✓ Good |
| Auto-detect + config override for linked repos | Parent dir scan works for flat layouts, config.json for custom setups | ✓ Good |
| Canvas not SVG for graph UI | SVG degrades at 30+ nodes, Canvas scales to 100+ | ✓ Good |
| Web Worker for D3 force simulation | Keeps main thread free for smooth 60fps interaction | ✓ Good |
| Cross-impact v2 as separate milestone | Service dependency intelligence is a major new capability | ✓ Good |
| CSS pixel space as single coordinate truth | DPR is render-time only; no mouse/transform values multiplied by DPR | ✓ Good |
| Polling over SSE for log terminal | No zombie connection risk, 2s latency imperceptible for log viewer | ✓ Good |
| Named handlers for teardown | Module-scope named functions enable removeEventListener for project switching | ✓ Good |
| Shared logger factory with component tags | Enables log filtering without coupling modules to each other | ✓ Good |
| Graph dedup via MAX(id) GROUP BY name | Workaround for scan duplication — replaced by UNIQUE constraint in v2.2 | ✓ Good (resolved) |
| ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE over INSERT OR REPLACE | INSERT OR REPLACE cascade-deletes FK child rows; ON CONFLICT preserves row ID | ✓ Good |
| Scan version bracket (beginScan/endScan) | Atomic stale-row cleanup; failed scans leave old data intact | ✓ Good |
| Per-call resolveDb in MCP server | Module-level DB resolution was wrong for cross-project queries | ✓ Good |
| kind column on exposed_endpoints | Single table with discriminant vs separate tables per type — simpler queries, mismatch detection unchanged | ✓ Good |
| Embed exposes in /graph response | Single-load pattern avoids per-click API calls and async rendering complexity | ✓ Good |
| escapeHtml on scan-derived strings | Function signatures contain angle brackets that would be interpreted as HTML | ✓ Good |
| Infra guard first in getNodeType() | Before name heuristics — node named 'k8s-infra-lib' correctly returns 'infra' | ✓ Good |
| Custom grid layout over Dagre/ELK | Simple row-based layout per type layer; no external dependency needed for <100 nodes | ✓ Good |
| Separate actors table over extending services | Actors don't have repos, languages, or exposes — half the columns would be NULL | ✓ Good |
| node_metadata table for extensibility | Avoids migration bloat when future views (STRIDE, vulns, deployment) add data | ✓ Good |
| Outbound external actors from scan only | No config-based or inferred inbound actors — reduces hallucination risk | ✓ Good |
| Synthetic negative IDs for actor nodes | Avoids collision with service IDs in shared nodes array | ✓ Good |
| Services top, libraries middle, infra bottom | Infra is the foundation services run on — matches mental model | ✓ Good |
| Minimal top bar with collapsible filter panel | Keeps UI clean; all power behind one button | ✓ Good |
| Layered scanning approach | Core scan unchanged; future views get their own optional scan passes | ✓ Good |
| Boundary config in ligamen.config.json | User-defined grouping avoids hallucination from auto-inference | ✓ Good |
| Clean break rename (no backwards compat) | No dual-name confusion; simpler codebase; user chose no migration path | ✓ Good |
| Parallel phase execution for rename | All 7 phases independent for string replacement; 2-day turnaround | ✓ Good |
| Remove K8s commands (pulse, deploy-verify) | Kubernetes-specific, doesn't fit core focus on code quality and cross-repo intelligence | ✓ Good |
| Port drift logic to JS for MCP (not shell out) | Clean testability, matches existing queryChanged pattern, no env var conflicts | ✓ Good |
| Filesystem queries at call time (no new DB tables) | Drift data changes too frequently to persist; repos table has paths as anchors | ✓ Good |
| Marketplace structure with plugins/ligamen/ | Matches official Claude Code marketplace format; enables `claude plugin marketplace add` | ✓ Good |
| marketplace.json at repo root | Required for marketplace discovery; points to ./plugins/ligamen as plugin source | ✓ Good |
| Install into CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT not CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA | ESM ignores NODE_PATH; directory-walk finds node_modules next to server.js | ✓ Good |
| Diff sentinel in CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA | Persists across plugin updates; double-check with node_modules existence | ✓ Good |
| Self-healing MCP wrapper over hook-only approach | Covers first-session race where MCP starts before SessionStart hook completes | ✓ Good |
| Separate install-deps.sh script (not inline in session-start.sh) | Clean separation; different timeout requirements (120s vs 10s) | ✓ Good |
| .mcp.json points to wrapper script not node directly | Enables self-healing path; wrapper handles dep check before exec | ✓ Good |
| Size-based log rotation over external logrotate | No external dependency; 10MB/3-file cap fits plugin use case | ✓ Good |
| TTY-aware stderr suppression | Daemon mode writes to file only; interactive mode keeps stderr for debugging | ✓ Good |
| Logger injection pattern for QueryEngine | Backwards-compatible optional arg; falls back to console.warn | ✓ Good |
| Three-value crossing semantics | external/cross-service/internal captures nuance that binary external/internal missed | ✓ Good |
| Post-scan reconciliation over prompt-only fix | Agents can't know what other repos contain; post-scan has full context | ✓ Good |
| Mono-repo detection via subdirectory manifests | Simple heuristic (one level deep) catches common layouts without recursive scan | ✓ Good |
