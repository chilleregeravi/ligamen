# AllClear

## What This Is

An open-source Claude Code plugin that provides automated quality gates, cross-repo service dependency intelligence, and continuous formatting/linting hooks for multi-repository development workflows. Includes an interactive graph UI for visualizing service dependencies with real-time log observability. Designed for teams managing multiple repos across Python, Rust, TypeScript, and Go — detects project type automatically and runs the right tools without configuration.

## Core Value

Every edit is automatically formatted and linted, every quality check runs with one command, and breaking changes across repos are caught before they ship.

### Active

(Defined per milestone — see current milestone below)

### Out of Scope

- Linear issue enrichment — other plugins cover this; no external service dependencies
- GitHub Issues integration — same reasoning
- Any issue tracker integration — keep AllClear focused on code and infrastructure
- RamaEdge-specific logic — plugin must remain generic and framework-agnostic
- Auto-fix for test/typecheck failures — unsafe, may silently alter code semantics
- xterm.js interactive terminal — log viewer uses styled div, not a full terminal emulator

## Context

Shipped v3.0 with ~12,000 LOC (Node.js worker, Canvas UI, shell scripts, bats tests). 38 phases across 6 milestones, 68 plans. Plugin installed via marketplace and operational.

Architecture: commands/ for user-invoked features, skills/ for auto-invoked knowledge, hooks/ for formatting/linting/guarding, worker/ for Node.js daemon (db/, server/, scan/, mcp/, ui/ subdirectories), lib/ for shared bash/JS libraries. Agent scan prompts modularized into type-specific variants (service, library, infra) with shared common component. Graph UI uses deterministic layered layout with boundary grouping, external actor hexagons, and protocol-differentiated edges. Filter panel provides protocol, layer, boundary, language, mismatch, and isolated-node toggles.

Known tech debt: no log rotation, db/database.js has console.log in script-mode guard, getQueryEngineByHash inline migration workaround, renderLibraryConnections() unused `outgoing` parameter, node_metadata table unused (forward-looking for STRIDE/vuln views), query-engine-upsert.test.js pre-existing failure (test schema missing migrations 5-8).

## Constraints

- **Plugin format**: Must follow Claude Code plugin conventions (commands/, skills/, hooks.json)
- **Framework-agnostic**: Detect project type from files, never assume a specific framework
- **No external service deps**: Every command must work with only local files, git, and optionally kubectl
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Testing**: Bats-core for hook shell scripts, node:test for worker JS
- **Detect, don't configure**: Infer everything from project files; zero-config by default with optional overrides via allclear.config.json
- **Non-blocking hooks**: Format/lint hooks must not block edits on failure — warn and continue
- **Cross-repo discovery**: Auto-detect linked repos from parent directory, override with config file

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Dedicated repo (not part of claude-code) | Clean separation between private orchestration and open-source plugin | ✓ Good |
| Drop /allclear scope | Other plugins handle issue enrichment; keeps AllClear zero external deps | ✓ Good |
| Apache 2.0 license | Permissive with patent protection, standard for dev tools | ✓ Good |
| Auto-detect + config override for linked repos | Parent dir scan works for flat layouts, config.json for custom setups | ✓ Good |
| Canvas not SVG for graph UI | SVG degrades at 30+ nodes, Canvas scales to 100+ | ✓ Good |
| Web Worker for D3 force simulation | Keeps main thread free for smooth 60fps interaction | ✓ Good |
| Cross-impact v2 as separate milestone | Service dependency intelligence is a major new capability | ✓ Good |
| CSS pixel space as single coordinate truth | DPR is render-time only; no mouse/transform values multiplied by DPR | ✓ Good |
| Polling over SSE for log terminal | No zombie connection risk, 2s latency imperceptible for log viewer | ✓ Good |
| Named handlers for teardown | Module-scope named functions enable removeEventListener for project switching | ✓ Good |
| Shared logger factory with component tags | Enables log filtering without coupling modules to each other | ✓ Good |
| Graph dedup via MAX(id) GROUP BY name | Workaround for scan duplication — replaced by UNIQUE constraint in v2.2 | ✓ Good (resolved) |
| ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE over INSERT OR REPLACE | INSERT OR REPLACE cascade-deletes FK child rows; ON CONFLICT preserves row ID | ✓ Good |
| Scan version bracket (beginScan/endScan) | Atomic stale-row cleanup; failed scans leave old data intact | ✓ Good |
| Per-call resolveDb in MCP server | Module-level DB resolution was wrong for cross-project queries | ✓ Good |
| kind column on exposed_endpoints | Single table with discriminant vs separate tables per type — simpler queries, mismatch detection unchanged | ✓ Good |
| Embed exposes in /graph response | Single-load pattern avoids per-click API calls and async rendering complexity | ✓ Good |
| escapeHtml on scan-derived strings | Function signatures contain angle brackets that would be interpreted as HTML | ✓ Good |
| Infra guard first in getNodeType() | Before name heuristics — node named 'k8s-infra-lib' correctly returns 'infra' | ✓ Good |
| Custom grid layout over Dagre/ELK | Simple row-based layout per type layer; no external dependency needed for <100 nodes | ✓ Good |
| Separate actors table over extending services | Actors don't have repos, languages, or exposes — half the columns would be NULL | ✓ Good |
| node_metadata table for extensibility | Avoids migration bloat when future views (STRIDE, vulns, deployment) add data | ✓ Good |
| Outbound external actors from scan only | No config-based or inferred inbound actors — reduces hallucination risk | ✓ Good |
| Synthetic negative IDs for actor nodes | Avoids collision with service IDs in shared nodes array | ✓ Good |
| Services top, libraries middle, infra bottom | Infra is the foundation services run on — matches mental model | ✓ Good |
| Minimal top bar with collapsible filter panel | Keeps UI clean; all power behind one button | ✓ Good |
| Layered scanning approach | Core scan unchanged; future views get their own optional scan passes | ✓ Good |
| Boundary config in allclear.config.json | User-defined grouping avoids hallucination from auto-inference | ✓ Good |
