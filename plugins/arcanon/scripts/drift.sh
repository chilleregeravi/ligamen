Usage: bash scripts/drift.sh <subcommand> [flags...]

Subcommands:
  versions   Library version drift across linked repos
  types      Type-definition drift across same-language linked repos
  openapi    OpenAPI spec drift across linked repos
  all        Run versions, types, and openapi sequentially (default)
  licenses   (reserved — not yet implemented)
  security   (reserved — not yet implemented)

Flags are passed through unchanged to subcommand scripts.
Direct invocation of `bash scripts/drift-*.sh` remains supported.
