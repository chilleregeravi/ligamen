# Arcanon Status

Print a compact status report for the current repo.

Run:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hub.sh status
```

The script reports:
- Installed plugin version
- Resolved config file (`arcanon.config.json` or legacy fallback)
- Project slug (from config)
- Credential presence (missing → suggest `/arcanon:login`)
- Whether `hub.auto-sync` is enabled
- Queue stats: pending / dead counts + oldest pending timestamp
- Data directory path (`~/.arcanon/` or legacy `~/.ligamen/`)

Relay the output verbatim. If anything is obviously broken (missing
credentials with auto-sync on, dead rows in queue, legacy data dir in
use), call it out with the appropriate next command.
