/**
 * worker/scan/enrichment/actor-labeler.js —  / .
 *
 * Per-repo actor labeling pass. Invoked from manager.js once per repo, after
 * the per-service enrichment loop and BEFORE the slog('INFO', 'enrichment
 * done', ...) line so that the actor labels become part of the same scan
 * version's view of the world.
 *
 * Self-healing: writes label = ? for EVERY actor connected to the given repo,
 * passing NULL when the catalog has no match. Removing an entry from the
 * catalog clears the corresponding actors.label on the next scan rather than
 * leaving a stale label in place.
 *
 * Failure-isolated: any error inside this pass is caught, logged at WARN, and
 * the scan continues. Mirrors the runEnrichmentPass posture in enrichment.js.
 *
 * SQL safety: actor IDs are looked up from the DB itself, not from user
 * input. The UPDATE statement uses parameterized binding for both label and
 * id, so there is no SQL-injection surface for catalog-supplied label
 * strings (they are bound parameters, never spliced into SQL).
