/**
 * worker/cli/correct-resolver.js — service-name → service.id resolver for
 * arcanon:correct .
 *
 * Pure helper. Extracted from cmdCorrect so the resolution logic — the
 * non-trivial branch of the handler — can be unit-tested with an in-memory
 * better-sqlite3 db without spawning the worker or stubbing the whole CLI.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - 1 match  → returns the integer service id.
 *   - 0 match  → throws { code: "NOT_FOUND", message: "service '<n>' not found", exitCode: 2 }.
 *   - >1 match → throws { code: "AMBIGUOUS", message: "<friendly disambiguation>", exitCode: 2 }.
 *
 * Caller is responsible for catching the thrown object, writing to stderr,
 * and exiting with `err.exitCode`. Throwing structured errors keeps the
 * resolver pure and the handler I/O at the boundary.
