/**
 * Scan-version selector resolver —, , Task 1 .
 *
 * Translates an operator-supplied scan-version selector (one of four shapes:
 * integer ID, HEAD/HEAD~N, ISO 8601 date or timestamp, or branch name) into
 * a concrete `scan_versions.id` number.
 *
 * Engine-shape contract (load-bearing for  shadow-DB reuse):
 *
 *   - Takes a raw `better-sqlite3` Database handle (NOT a projectRoot, NOT a
 *     pool key). The caller owns DB lifecycle. This module never opens,
 *     closes, attaches, or mutates the handle it receives.
 *
 *   - Pool-agnostic: imports nothing from `worker/db/pool.js` or
 *     `worker/db/database.js`.  (`/arcanon:diff --shadow`) opens a
 *     shadow DB itself and passes the handle here without going through the
 *     pool. Adding any pool import would break that contract — see
 *     115-RESEARCH.md §8 for the full  dependency promise.
 *
 *   - Read-only: only SELECT statements. No INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
 *     anywhere in this module.
 *
 * Selector resolution precedence (applied in this exact order, per
 * 115-RESEARCH.md §5.5):
 *
 *   1. /^\d+$/                         → integer scan_versions.id
 *   2. /^HEAD(?:~(\d+))?$/             → HEAD~N offset over completed scans
 *   3. /^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})(T.*)?$/   → ISO 8601 date or full timestamp
 *   4. fall through                    → branch name (requires projectRoot)
 *
 * **Bare integer always wins** over a 4-digit-year reading. `2026` resolves
 * as integer ID 2026, NEVER as the year 2026. If the operator wants to
 * select the year, they must pass `2026-01-01` (the date form). This is an
 * intentional ergonomic call that matches `git diff <sha> <sha>` UX — see
 * 115-RESEARCH.md §7 question 7 for the rationale.
 *
 * Branch resolver uses `execFileSync` exclusively (NOT shell `exec` /
 * `execSync` / `spawn`). The branch name is passed as an argv element to
 * git, never interpolated into a shell string. This is enforced by a
 * regression test in `resolve-scan.test.js` (test 14) that greps the
 * source. Threat T-115-01-01 in the plan threat model — a shell-exec'd
 * user-controlled branch name would be a command-injection vulnerability.
