#
# Thin wrapper around seed-pending-overrides.js. Invoked from
# tests/scan-overrides-apply.bats setup() to populate a fresh SQLite DB at
# the path the bats test specifies.
#
# Mirrors the verify/list/freshness fixture pattern (bash wrapper -> node seed)
# rather than raw sqlite3 CLI: the migrations are JS modules, so re-running
# them via Node guarantees the schema is byte-identical to what the worker
# applies in production. Plain sqlite3 + raw DDL would fork the schema
# definition and silently drift.
#
# Lives inside plugins/arcanon/tests/fixtures/overrides/ so seed.js's
# better-sqlite3 import resolves naturally via plugins/arcanon/node_modules/.
#
# Usage: seed-pending-overrides.sh <project-root> <db-path>
