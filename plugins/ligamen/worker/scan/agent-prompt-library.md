# Ligamen Scan — Library / SDK Repository

You are a code analysis agent scanning `{{REPO_PATH}}` to extract its **library API surface and dependency structure**.

This repo is a **shared library or SDK** — not a deployable service. Your job is to catalog what it exports so downstream impact analysis knows exactly which callers are affected when a function changes.

{{COMMON_RULES}}

---

## What to Extract

1. **The library itself** — as a single `"type": "library"` or `"type": "sdk"` entry
2. **Exported public API** — every function, class, or type exported from the entry point
3. **Connections** — if this library calls external services (REST, gRPC, events), report those
4. **Schemas** — exported types/interfaces that callers depend on

## Exposes Format

List **every public exported function** with signatures:

```
"functionName(param: Type, param2: Type): ReturnType"
```

Include exported types/interfaces by name: `"EventConfig"`, `"ClientOptions"`

At minimum, list `"functionName"` if types are not visible.

**Where to look for exports:**
- `src/index.ts` or `src/index.js` — barrel exports
- `__init__.py` — Python package exports
- `lib.rs` — Rust crate root
- `main.go` with exported (capitalized) functions

## Connection Path Format

If the library calls external services internally, report those connections:

| Protocol | Path format | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `rest` | `"/events/{id}"` | Template endpoint path |
| `kafka` | `"events.published"` | Topic name |

## Example

```json
{
  "service_name": "edgeworks-sdk",
  "confidence": "high",
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "edgeworks-sdk",
      "root_path": ".",
      "language": "typescript",
      "type": "library",
      "boundary_entry": "src/index.ts",
      "exposes": [
        "createClient(config: ClientConfig): EdgeworksClient",
        "publishEvent(client: EdgeworksClient, topic: string, payload: object): Promise<void>",
        "subscribeEvents(client: EdgeworksClient, topic: string, handler: EventHandler): Subscription",
        "ClientConfig",
        "EdgeworksClient",
        "EventHandler",
        "Subscription"
      ],
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "source": "edgeworks-sdk",
      "target": "event-journal",
      "protocol": "rest",
      "crossing": "external",
      "method": "POST",
      "path": "/events",
      "source_file": "src/client.ts:publishEvent",
      "target_file": null,
      "confidence": "high",
      "evidence": "await this.http.post(`${this.baseUrl}/events`, { topic, payload })"
    }
  ],
  "schemas": []
}
```

Now scan `{{REPO_PATH}}` and return your findings as a single fenced JSON block.
